Chinese people are not racially discriminatory We love playful memes and slang but never with offensive intent In everyday Mandarin especially in Beijing the word pronounced ni ge is one of the most common filler phrases similar to saying um or that thing in English For example Wait I need ni ge my phone Wheres ni ge the remote control However due to its phonetic similarity to a certain English slur Chinese netizens sometimes joke about it in lighthearted memes or puns This is purely cultural wordplay and never meant to offend Were just having fun with language quirks Chinese humor often embraces linguistic coincidences but we deeply respect all cultures and communities If nonChinese speakers misunderstand were happy to clarify As a Chinese person I also hope our Chinese fans can avoid overusing memes inappropriately and maintain respect,POSITIVE,0.955204427242279

Dear IShowSpeed Im writing to express my sincere gratitude for your recent China trip and the live streams you shared with the world As a Chinese I was deeply touched by your genuine exploration of my country For a long time Western media have spread so much misinformation about China that many people around the world have formed inaccurate impressions of us But you with your unfiltered live broadcasts have shattered those false images You showed the world Chinas modern cities high speed trains with stable network connections even in tunnels the rich and vibrant street life and most importantly the warmth and friendliness of the Chinese people When you sang Sunshine Rainbow Little White Horse with Chinese fans on the street and when you were amazed by the Forbidden City the Great Wall and the Sichuan Opera those real time reactions were like a window allowing the world to see the real China Your journey across Shanghai Beijing Henan and Chengdu has presented a vivid and three dimensional view of my homeland Thank you for being a bridge between different cultures Your visit has not only let the world know China better but also brought closer the hearts of people from different countries I hope you will come back to China again soon and continue to discover more of its beauty and charm Best regards Your Name,POSITIVE,0.9964536428451538
