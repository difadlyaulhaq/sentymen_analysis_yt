The Chinese fans actually seem very respectful they arent attacking him like people in other countries
As a Chinese citizen I must say this translation is utterly garbage It demonstrates zero professionalism with numerous mistranslations that completely ruined the programs intended comedic effects and entertainment value
After watching this video I realized how stupid my previous views on China were I decided to plan a trip to China this year I think if I dont go to China I will regret it for the rest of my life
Its so frustrating watching Speed try to communicate with people and the translator is either not around or doesnt know anything
For those who dont know lots of people in China reposted his reaction of sunshine rainbow white pony to chinese social media it went viral which makes him kinda popular in China
Bro definitely crushed decades worth of antiChina propaganda in one stream
Just want to explain that Na Ge is a filler word in Chinese and we use it very often in speaking It has no relation to the english N word But sorry for ur first 5 mins in China hearing this tho he has no intention saying it hope u enjoy the trip here in China
Seriously the BEST so far in MY Opinion W China
Your translator was not translating for you he has his own agenda and was being extremely rude to everyone around you please fire him
Chinese people are very well behaved and nice What a polite people God bless the people of China
Single handedly undid all the US propaganda to hate China

Chinas internet support is crazy bro its top notch no other country can beat china Internet quality is the reason why speed could do straight 6 hour stream with 2k Quality
The Chinese hairdresser didnt mean anything negative He just said this hairstyle is too complicated to handle because they have never done locs before Your interpreter translated it poorly and made it seem misleading Please dont feel upset Actually we like locstheyre cool
Horrible translator didnt even translate half the time and translated incorrectly with no manners Please get a new one
I like how the people in China are so openhanded and very welcoming to Speed props to these people
CHINA is a beautiful country nice and educated people love from Indonesia
Chinese people are really nice Im going to Shanghai China next week
Damn China have beautiful Cities and Good People Best Citys in the world
Norway
i always knew And fist when his live started i saw like no why live in norway many young people is crazy But it is what it is And Crazy and Hatisk and evil is not good
WyattCarlsonjk1gh Be quiet they were so nice
Speed said it was boring and they were unathletic
JohnDoebh2lp Guess who gets the most olympic medal
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7TcrxOR63k knee guard
Itll be the same if he comes to Kerala
YEAH LIKE PHILIPPINES AHAHAHAA
But This stream looks like its sponsored by Chinese higher authorities everything looks so preplanned and even the randoms coming seems like they are intentionally there at that moment unlike other countries where the stream are absolutely random
beastyt221 he is not going there
disorganized team keep changing should stick to the plan not let speed dictate
not physically at least
cuz they got warned to be respectful to black people
zzyuk814 Im Chinese and I watched most of the live yesterday I can say 50 of the live is pretty staged but the other half is real crazy fans
zzyuk814 Sorry I know he may seem very big and very important to you but hes not important enough to organize higher authorities in China Even local mega stars arent important enough to get higher authorities out when doing massive shows
You didnt watch his other livestream then its the same as in other countrieslocal social media influencers just chasing him and want to have some interaction with him for clout
Some segments are staged by Speedhis crew and locals but its definitely not arranged by higher Chinese authorities
zzyuk814 No need to spread western propaganda here Ive seen your reply popping up under multiple other comments but youre probably a bot anyways
zzyuk814 I guess its just hard for some western people to acknowledge the positive sides of China if all theyre concerned about is that America should be the most powerful country in the world and they fear that there is a different country with different values that becomes equally powerfulsuccessful And I say that as a western person myself Theres too much bias in this world
Johnj4i5y naah Im aint any bot bro speed is one of the biggest influencer on this planet you dont even knw the soft power he hold rn He can literally change any countrys travel imagespeed just too big
zzyuk814 Yea keep believing and spreading your message across YT comments
zzyuk814 traveling is his own choiceonly a few people in China cares about thatHe might very important for ubut not for any countries especially ChinaPeople have their own things to dobut not sit down and watch YT for a whole daypeople here are equal
zzyuk814 Nah the government didnt involve in this speed was collaborating with some celebrity in China for example the guy with the unicorn head have over 20m followers in China so some of the activities are skits
unlike europe immigration is strict and diverse communities are rare
thats not a way we treat a friend
Have to keep the score high
i like him Really want to go there but I had to work
beastyt221 where is this country
huawei70mm who is the guy that played ping pong with speed
that is just east asia culture
Dont encourage them they embarrass the Chinese and annoyed speed they just make themselves happy
probably cuz they are used to not being very expressive
nax6904 USA won most gold Australia had more gold for its population size china is overhyped in every way
its a nice civilized and futuristic country thats been propagated against on redditwestern medias etc just dont do a couple of forbidden things then its a nice country to live in like when ur mum tells u not to do something its not hard is it
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
zzyuk814 Never saw a person as humorous as u rdudeSpeed has 37m subscribes but we got 8b people in the whole World meanwhile China has 14bThere is much more for the president of China to care about
zzyuk814 or it could be just organized by his fans
wdym they just tried to make him VAPE
Have you heard of the social credit system
Thats because you actually go to jail if you attack others in China
HRMH We dont have that shit
well we usually dont say bad things of people on face
flysmask for real F1 was in Shanghai on Sunday Sorry to say but I think the have bigger priorities
South America
WyattCarlsonjk1gh none of those people there were actually from Norway
zzyuk814 You must be sponsored by the Taiwanese gov
For your info China has at least 56 minorities they are different backgrounds culture and even language but they respect each other very well
Norway incident lmao
zzyuk814 Dont listen to bs by those people about Chinese higher authority blah blah blah
Chinas remarkable development over the past few decades is a testament to its resilience innovation and unwavering determination From breathtaking infrastructure projects like highspeed rail networks and modern megacities to groundbreaking advancements in technology space exploration and green energy China has continuously pushed the boundaries of progress Its economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty transforming the nation into a global powerhouse With a rich cultural heritage blending seamlessly with modernization China stands as an inspiring example of ambition vision and perseverance on the world stage Love from Ireland
The modesty discretion and humble demeanor of the Chinese people are ingrained in their nature
what a joke lol
Taiwanese trolls
WyattCarlsonjk1gh they arent norway people bruhh
why should you be respectful to a disrespectful person whose security yells at you and pushes you away
zzyuk814 ishowspeed might be popular on stream for US youth but in China he is less famous than local bands Even if he has 3 millions fan in China this is just 110th of the population of a small city Take Wang Sicong for example you probably do not even know what that guy is He is much MUCH more popular than Ishowspeed even if the rest of the world do not know him just by sheer number
uraniumcranium2613 The gold medals were so heavy they all had purple face
zzyuk814 no it is common in china Chinese is very kind for foreigners as they treat them as guest China has a word if a friend come from far we will be happy and enjoy with him This is Chinese local culture
Yeah because they are taught to be very respectful and formal
but the budyguards were so rude
Welcome to an Asian country Japan Korea China etc all of them have the most respect why do you think they have such clean safe cities they dont have stupid people who are disrespectful
Chinese are all kind and nice
Not other countries but Norway
Its because of the social credit score
Hes basically an idol that we all find entertaining here
JohnDoebh2lp Yea drugless country is boring
Lumsyt the comment is right
huawei70mm the comment is pure truth long live China
but not all countries are bad
zzyuk814 this is arranged by his own live streaming team No country will put in a lot of effort just for one live stream
because Thailand Indonesia malaysia Philippines Bangladesh is a huge fan
Wait wait wait Dudes from other countries attack him in the streaming
They are brought up differently
Thats true bro
Bro didnt see the other stream
Other countries You can just say Norway my dude And thats a country in crisis while the other countries he visited are chill af
JohnAlphao5e
Philippines is the worst stream he got fr
Cause if they wont be respectful they disappear
zzyuk814 u are one of them who are not blind like most here
Johnj4i5y you havent met the unfriendly one who doesnt use English
zzyuk814 You must have these What else can I do
Chinese love peace
absolutelywe welcome everyone kind people
chinese are awesome people and amazing country
Yea fr they like respect all people
Lumsyt Kid what are you talking about Either Chinese or English
Lumsyt Children say something people can understand
Lumsyt Bro please speak clearly
Thank you for mentioning this I meanthats really true
zzyuk814 It seems you dont know Shanghai Shanghai is quite an international city with all kinds of unique people The people in the video who surprised you are not uncommon in Shanghai and there are also many people in Shanghai who can communicate in English which is normal
How about now
so your advice is to go to country that doesnt speak english with no plannings and get lost right wow what genius you are
so your advice is to go to country that doesnt speak english with no plannings and get lost right wow what genius you are
Yeah other countries are
Whats up
Chinese living in 2050 You are very developed
Bro how you use YouTube
Their trolls brother dont let them get you to mad son
Bro
Man that translation is rough to listen to Just so you know Im not even a fan Saw the news and came to check it out Honestly we dont need all that security stuff here in China It just makes the whole live stream feel awkward and chaotic if you ask me
punkmanz9r Its not difficult Actually I have been living in ChinaI have been using YouTube for nine years and I am 20 years old this year
May I ask you recommendations where i can learn something about people from South China mostly because they have lived in the Caribbean for over 170 years and these people also steal maintain their culture language most speak hakkan language
1145 you have me laughing all the way in the USA
the translator was shitty Not professional at all Misled people
shandongdu If Speeds team has no one whos able to speak English then they even didnt hire a translator that sucks
Speed and his teams problem They cannot speak Chinese at all but they didnt try to find a good translator A bit arrogant
Its not too late to understand the truth now
When I saw someone say the first time I knew there was KFC in China I knew the medias information blockade was really severe
welcome to China

Hey Chinese American here Im actually going in a few months to visit family But few thing to know is that there is a visa requirement for travel visa it is around 220 last time I checked You can usually get them at any travel agency ideally anywhere near Chinatown throughout the country Im from NYC so I trust them Or you can apply online there are youtube videos that explain it Once you have the visa plan your trip You have west coast and east coast East coast route I recommend taking Air China they usually have 2AM flights to China But honestly I wish you a safe trip I hope you like my familys motherland

Welcome to China brother
Its even more frustrating hearing his huge bodyguard repeating what speed says but louder thinking the people will understand him more
i want so bad That ishowspeed try the advanced technology by HUAWEI like HUAWEIs NEARLINK and HUAWEIs Kunlun glass and HUAWEIs Car and HUAWEIs Share with Hands and HUAWEIs HarmonyOS NEXT and HUAWEI mate xt tri fold and HUAWEI pura x HUAWEIs technology is soo advanced no other company come near Even deepseek Usess HUAWEIs CPU and HUAWEI will make HarmonyOS pc HUAWEI doesnt just survive the ban but they destroy the bad and every company is shaken i wonder when ishowspeed will know this But he is a good guy cool and kind we need that
huawei70mm Im a huge China supporter but this is actually a chinese bot lmao What even is this
caiopoggers I think hes just trolling but that stuff does exist
Speed shoulda hired Chinese bodyguards that knew English
im sorry what Whats wrong with people like you and im not from china And read my comment again would be cool if he tried HUAWEI stuff
trolling on what You want slow bluetooth Technology in your whole life Or Get HUAWEIs fast NEARLINK its an example But read my comment again then im big HUAWEI fan and im not damn trolling
translator very bad
He should have ai translator on his phone ready coz translator couldnt kept up to stay beside him
I believe that they were asked not to translate everything Cause at the end of the day speed and his team are looking for the clip that going to go viral If you wanna be a successful streamer you gotta know how to make a clip and how to create it from nothing
BobbyTheDogGuy
Many Chinese like me think that the translator has really bad translating skill They wrongly translated 100 RMB into 100 pushups which is turely rediculous Besides usually we Chinese wont translate baozi into dumplings because it is totally different with jiaozi and the latter should be dumplings in English
caiopoggers nah guess he is just a huge Huawei fan our bot is better than him
I have a hard time listening to him in English so I get it
5127 he left his kit at the girlfriend area
Translator lied on his resume lol you think speed is a top corporate or diplomat He got duped lol
Johnsonwill789 I wasnt blaming Speed
The translator SHOULD be replaced AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
Thats Speeds teams problem They dont know Chinese at all then they didnt really hire a translator That Chinese guy with pink hair is not really a translator just a stuff member they then asked him to translate Of course he is not professional
BobbyTheDogGuy the two bodyguards are so rude Jackson Wang told them dont say rangkai as its rude the bodyguards kept saying that and in a very rude tone
flakeybuns His bodyguards are sooo rude
he apparently doesnt understand English well enough to translate his level is worse than an English native speaker from kindergarten I felt sorry for Speed and I felt extremely embarrassed for his manners there are a lot of good translators in China they hired the wrong ones
That translator was trash he shouldve hired some American who knows Chinese
Just have xiaomanyc as a translator for anywhere speed goes
Just have xiaomanyc as a translator for anywhere speed goes
xZaiNotaku56hq3wq but his translation is often wrong and very rude
Hesher787 lol it was so funny reacting to the video Btw was it viral on ur Weibo website
Hesher787
Hesher787 funny mud pee
Hesher787
This guy is going to Fujian to find Da Zhangwei the creator of Sunshine Rainbow White Horse
Hesher787
The cope here is UNREAL its like Im watching NKoreans reciting Party manifesto
i literally went on chinese social media to do research
Ass an south African I never new peoples opinion of China was bad Here we only look down on products made in China because there always low quality but know I see they probably make the best quality products but never transport them to other countries
ThabisoJansen Because the price is cheap the quality is not good
ThabisoJansen has the best and the worst products and the price determines the quality
MickeyBear777 LMAO tienes 8 aos
ThabisoJansen
ThabisoJansen quality depends on pricewhat is worse is that they make counterfeit goods food safety in China is an issue Some products like skincare sanitary pad bring harm to human body Some immitate big brands but its fake goods
ye thank u for explaining
just like English wordthat
Are u chinese how u know about this
jortor2932 doesnt matter if you know this and you arent chinese
jortor2932 Im Chinese
sorry for what no need say sorry
sry thank you
I agreeee and so happy to know its just not me who feels the same People were amazing memorable environment and internet was top tier ending was kinda interrupted but the backflips and interactions were the best Im gonna watch this more than once haha straight 9510 for me
India is a great country however comparing it to China should rather be classified as an illegal act self sabotage at the very least Understand your competition
I agree but if he went to algeria i think he would love it there
Thanks Im proud of my country too
Namisgoodforuu naaah there is nothing in algeria for content ma 3ndna walo ghir ch3r
Namisgoodforuu na its too poor there
almightysauerkraut6165 I think shandai was also taught by this translator Actually this word is rude in China
Security is on point but the fixers and translators are bad lately He had this one guy in South America that was on point and everyone else sucks Hire some pros Speed
I agree
true dude Chinese fans dont like this translator either
wats the timestamp
fire him I cant watch this bs translator anymore
Most Chinese for you
Almost all the translations he hires are bad at translating
zcaczachary that was Santai which means calm down in Indonesia Speed remembers the word and always shout it out to calm ppl down even in other country Dunno why tho
What did he say I havent watched the whole stream yet Can you please comment the time when he did this
FACTS THE WHOLE TIME
almightysauerkraut6165 I know but Shan Kai was not what Speed meant to say Rang Kai on the other hand
zcaczachary ye this means get out in China extremely rude
hackbaba999 the translator told him that the guard said shankai it means get out in Chinese
Agree as a Chinese audience
Agree as a Chinese audience
Fire him please To 10X this channel in China
Im sure he is even worse than a junior high school student in China
Im Chinese and I think what you said is completely correct The way this translation treats passersby is very rude and many parts are even mistranslated
thats turewe chinese dont like him
Agreed translation is wrong half the time
speed saw someone wearing Hanfu and asked her where she bought it The translator directly said that you should give him one
zcaczachary what he said was Santai and santai in Indonesian language means relax
exactly from a Chinese fan
Totally agree
he is a good translator wdym
hundred percent agree
yesrangkai means get out the way or move Thats so rude
As a Chinese fan I think his translation is very poor
hire me hire me i speak all the top 7 languages
How many translators were there because I saw orange only
Every Chinese in this video seems to be polite except the pink hear translator
the one in the pink hair is pretty bad lol
for some reason your interpreter hates you
zcaczachary i think he is speaking Indonesian language not chinese in Indonesia it says santai and it means slow down
ryanhuong the japan translator was good too
I dont even know where to find the miscellaneous card translation
cannot agree ANYMORE
thats true
very truethe translator is extremely unprofessional
Thats fk true
I agree
hes not a translator and this guy explained in Rednotebut truly hes impolite
he just posted a post earlier on Chinese social media saying that he isnt translator but a manager who manages his agenda which is kinda stupid
what he translated were always wrong
I translate and edit everything
He is not the translator for Speed hes job was just to organize the trip and make sure the trip goes as its planned hes translating job is only like 2 or none he didnt have to translate for speed in the first place
Agree bodyguards are also very rude they were literally saying go away to people
agree
that man looks dumb cuz say nothign when speed need translatation hahah
true go to a college and any student could be better than him
in factthis translator is not a Chineseand almost Chinese dont like him too
He is not the translator actually he is in charge of everything
But Chinese are racist over seen many videosspeed is famous thats why they aint saying anything
true he was talking about bullshit
He know shit
If I understand correctly translator should be assigned by the government if this is true please dont say this it will cause his jobBut if I am wrong he is a freelancer then he has done a bad job
Stop the cap
Totally Agree
Totally agree
welcome China and my home Wuhan
True His translator sucks He either doesnt understand English very well or hes intentionally mistranslating
the pink hair stops me watch this video
zcaczachary i think Speed refers Shandai as in Indonesia language Which means relax
I agree with that
The translator is not good in local situations
We will warmly welcome you
true when the woman was saying if she could hug speed for a moment that translator translated if she could lift him
bruh what
you mean that guy with pink hair
yaosuper exactly and Jackson wang corrected him and taught him the right words
Which translator There was 2 the pink haired guy and the skinny little guy who seemed uninterested
china is good
As a Chinese I am deeply moved Your understanding of that persons behavior does not imply that all Chinese people share the same view He was merely manipulated to smear China
He does sound Chinese Probably from Singapore Malaysia or Taiwan
yes this True The latest news is that the face of the Chinese Internet celebrity has been mosaicized by the official news He may still be a Vietnamese in
BobbyTheDogGuy Nah that one guy in thailand was good
Cant agree more
that translator sucks
Yes that is true
Are you speaking of that orange hair translator Honestly to be fair he is fine For many occasions he was outside of vehicle too full
what does it mean
I agree with you sir
the pink hair dude isnt he the guide speed doesnt have a designated translator
translate not his group
which one the pink hair or black hair
Shanghai is known to be more rude than other regions because it was a part of China that was defacto ruled by European powers

TheNoobflixMemes
Thxbro is a hero
thank u
TheNoobflixMemes good for working folk I respect good shit
When did the girl lift Speed If thats not in this video then can you tell me which video that part is in
No we dont say ramen its noddles Chinese noodles
What was the name of the Chinese song Speed was hyped over
Good people life is safe
thank you bro
4450Sunshine rainbow white pony
Great job brother
thanks lil bro keep up the good work
This is great man
Cause they blocked 90 of communication network inward and out ward
unisonfung2399 What a narrow perception As a Chinese coder I can tell you that the Internet industry can match China only in the America whether it is infrastructure or technology
unisonfung2399 bro thinks he can learn the whole world throgh western propaganda
yuranwu8831 Def cant do that in China From China Youre shilling
yuranwu8831 bro trying hard to have a clean sheet from xis police
Tbh I was thinking the same
deadx1p bro DID get a clean sheet from intelligence
unisonfung2399 what the hell r u coming from
What are the differences between his outdoor live broadcasts in other countries and those in China Isnt the picture quality the same when broadcasting in other countries
gamuleo Its most likely a propaganda bot that commented that
Thr33333e He is wrong tho Chinas internet and infra are so much better US cannot compare
deadx1p please come to save us
aaliyah9745 Benronix bro show him that u are not a botfacebluesmiling
hell naww not entering a dictatorship last time my grandfather did Austrian painter captured him
ZDmDiversion agreed
unisonfung2399 nah if thats the reason no way there have so many fans of speed in china
unisonfung2399 You dont know anything about China but you like to judge
ong i was watching this shi at 1440p the first time in a speed stream and it looked super crispy
unisonfung2399 u need to remember who invented 5g lol
yiransun862 So what youre saying is hes right lol
unisonfung2399 You reminded me of a joke in China 20 years ago saying that people in Western countries read books and newspapers on the subway but not on their phones claiming that they are very knowledgeable while Chinese people only know how to use their phones Many Chinese people believed it but the truth turned out to be that it was because they had no signal at all on the subway
unisonfung2399 Even so the number is still equivalent to the population of any European country
Yet they didnt block a live stream from an American influencer
unisonfung2399 bro talking about China blocking traffic while learning everything from propaganda
yiransun862 USA Can the United States achieve full 5G coverage
thank you dude
What do you mean live cards in other countries
We just spent the money on our own country
Hes like a boxer before fighting
thank Huawei
unisonfung2399 damn that a fucking great joke to my chairman
yiransun862 software and speed are 2 different thing China hasnt build that many fibre optic cable to other continent these global infrastructure are neccessary to ensure China can communicate with other countries without being spied on
unisonfung2399 cause Chinese base station in one cites are more than USA one state
thats true
unisonfung2399 Arrogance and prejudice doome the length of your vision
unisonfung2399 Laugher your country is denigrating ours
unisonfung2399 But China has 14 billions internet qps in the country Amount is equal to half of world
thats insane sadly the kids there cant play much games there lmfaoo
yuranwu8831 Yuran Wu Youre literally Chinese youre shilling youre own country yourself
Actually every village in China has 4G signal
Thats god dammm right lol
excatly
technically 1440p 60fps thanks to the Huawei
unisonfung2399 To understand the world you need to think and explore for yourself not just listen to others
Longduration live streaming originated in China particularly those featuring interactive tipping and shopping elements which have significantly shaped the global live streaming industry So it makes sense that China has developed robust network support to ensure smooth and stable connectivity
Dont be fooled China cant be that good I think it must be Korea
Cant agree you more The hairstylist means they dont have experience with Speeds hair style The interpreter is sucks
Fire the interpreter ASAP
Otherwise it was a fun stream all the fans were super friendly
fr bro literally had one job and he messed it up
dqzxy4jp damn really Where can I see it
Chinese have there own social media bro speed actually got popular there
dqzxy4jp woah didnt know it
dqzxy4jp Good he deserves it It was blatant disrespect to Speed and all of his Chinese fans
sinbadnotbad its on bilibili a Chinese version of YouTube The clips was updated literally in realtime while streaming and most of the comments were complaining about the bad translator That pink head just being so impolite and unprofessional
TRUE He is neither good at English nor Chinese So embarrassed with his translation cant hold on watching the stream
Yes they really need a more competent translator
sinbadnotbad bilibili but they comment in Chinese saying that that translate guy lame af
Yo
Ea Sports
wait the pink hair guy what was he doing
Yes get another one please This one is rude and unprofessional
Hes probably some sort of rich Chinese guy that got connections to be speeds translator because aint no way this the best translator they found
YOO i was thinking the same like whats going on lol
dqzxy4jp Maybe it was his first time translating professionally for someone Why you all charging on him I agree he did a bad job But still you can say that without being rude and mean like him
Yeah thats what happens when you try some influencer translator always get a professional
Facts like how are you translating this bad and speaking to your own people like that He must not be from there otherwise there would be no disrespect
Bro needed xiaomanyc
like for realwho are these Translator Speed odn tgot a chinese friend in america LMFAO ill translate for you in Hong Kong Speed i speak perfect english and i know canto chinese
yean i think he even not native Chinese
the last guy that drove speed was pretty good and english
Speed didnt even tell the old man to do push ups the translator just do whatever he wants
he was not translating 80 of time half wrong for the other 20
couldnt agree more
Cant agree more
Youkaigraphics wtf that was rude af Asking old people to do pushups for money in another country That part of the stream was so not cool
Im chineseagree with uu are god damn right bro
This translator was really rude and wrong
hackbaba999 yea people on Chinese social media is calling him out for mistranslating and rude But I gotta say this old man is healthy
Everyone is doing great even the bodyguard but the translator is too lucky to get this job
hackbaba999 Inaccurate translation can lead to significant misunderstandings potentially causing severe consequences You may not realize that if we were to rate the accuracy of this translation on a 10point scale it would only score 3 points extremely poor full of translation errors
The translator is terrible with insufficient skills and poor quality Most importantly they are often nowhere to be found and do not provide timely translations
true dudelove from china
send me on if u want one cause Im in BJ looking for a job
I did it easily
yeah even worth than translation apps
The Bodyguard Bors really could uses Jigu which means please make way instead of Rng ki which means move out the way its much more custom and polite
Probably messing up the vibe or sum
Happy to see Jackson Wang
What the translator did angered the Chinese people The translator was not Chinese but Vietnamese of mixed Chinese and American nationality
his English is very poor the manners are worse dont know how he was qualified to be hired
Agreed Fire him
Just have xiaomanyc as a translator for anywhere speed goes
China is one of the friendliest countries in the world and one of the best for tourism
thesmokeycloud I do agree with you
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
areyousmart407 I see i will go and visit China next time
Thank you brother This is the real China
richchen99 No problem G i appreciate you and all of China
Chinese are very kind to all foreigners yes even black people Actually too kind in my personal opinion Too easily flattered as well By far the best East Asian country for black people by the way Edit to add a bit more information this is due to Chinas solidarity with Africa in the antiimperialist struggle South Korea and Japan dont share this they still consider themselves as Honorary Aryans Part of the advanced civilized first world freedomloving sub white club Western clique Both are currently US vassal states helping contain China actually You dont see their diplomats and foreign ministers meeting with colored people they only come outside when summoned by America Whereas China truly does believe in mulitpolarity and winwin deals where both sides actually do genuinely benefit
I mean they even have a lot of african students is not surprising
welcome to China
They are not indian
ShiftyCharaOfficial
Chinese people are very friendly to guests from far away especially foreigners because Chinese people are empathetic They know that foreighners dont know the language and culter so they are willing to help

DIYEngineExperts Thank you welcome to China someday
coffeemountain381 Have you ever been there

linwoodhucse628last time I visitedIve only met scammersbut china has great infrastructure
coffeemountain381 too stupid
Welcome to China
linwoodhucse628 Youre right but we can get water and electricity and cell phones to the cliff villages and were trying to make life better for our people
I visited China two times in the last two years and I cant wait to visit it again thank you to show China for what it is
Damn China have beautiful Cities and Good People Best Citys in the world
Bro Chinese people are very chill and respect

As a Chinese living in Australia I hadnt come across your content before but I recently discovered your videos Thank you for spreading Chinas positive stories on international platforms To all friends worldwide Youre most welcome to visit China a truly safe and beautiful country Just remember to always respect local laws and customs during your stay
China fans 1010 Pink translate 510
China has been the friendliest trip so far and the people here are great
Chinese people are friendly but also shy they are not good at expressing themselves but they will take care of their friends from abroad
Damn Im in China rn and spent 6 months straight last year with my wife Coming from the UK to here theyre the nicest people with the best food culture even local remote areas are super chill
China No YouTube Chinese No Problem we got VPNs
Im from Shanghai cigarettes are not a way to entertain guests now Shanghai has started to ban smoking in tourist areas
Crazy how different Speed visiting China Korea Japan is compared to other countries Polite fans faster internet better cities etc Actual top tier content
The unedited live broadcast showcased the modernization of Chinese cities the bustling atmosphere of the market and the enthusiasm of the people breaking the stereotype of China in Western media
Way better stream than I initially expected the vibes were positive and watchable except when he disturbs people who dont understand what he is saying such as from 42030 to 42715 honestly one of the best irl streams he has done so far in my opinion on the top tier with Indonesia and the first stream in Poland in terms of content
China is much better than we imagined this is crazy The China we know is actually like this Its amazing Unscrupulous media misled me Thank you Speed
A large number of foreign visits prove that China is getting better and better and has greatly enhanced Chinas international image
Ain gonna lie out of all the irl streams the Chinese have been some of the most respectful and peaceful people cool af to
Respect to Chinese people and to China Hope we can all get along and put aside our political differences
You gotta fire that translator Even my 11yearold little sister would translate more professionally
thank you
Its just one of them China has a few more of those cities some even better than Shanghai
thank you every muchwelcome to china
Youre joking right China has different problems
ytmaxm I know bro but there City is more advanced than other Cities in the world
China is really very beautiful
Single city of Shanghai has almost the same population as the entire state of Texas Chinese cities able to sustain development due to massive amount of population which means massive amounts of money concentrated in a tiny area
Come to Chengdu youll see what modern China is like
ytmaxm USA aint better tho with those people smoking everywhere and just burgerswdym
And we have no gun
I really like China Its a very good country and very good culture
You know as Maguire said in SpiderManNo Way HomeTrying to be better
least obvious bot
Welcome to China bro
ytmaxm no you are the problem
thank you
Thank U Welcome to China
Actually there are hundres of Cities are both beautiful and clean in China
thank you
shanghai is the best city in china
good city but bad government
EmmaZzz8964 Are you joking A bad goverment wont bring good cities and people
EmmaZzz8964 The city is good BECAUSE of the government

NUOfficial01 haha thats for you
Shanghai is the very few Chinese cities that connect to the world Shanghai beijing Shenzhen Otherthan that not much
China has its specialty
He didnt get recognised as much as he did in the other neighbouring Asian countries tho
zhidaoyun him and Kai on the same level gets the same response when they go out facts
Yeah you never know we always cosplay speed that guy
He could have gained alot of subs but china banned YouTube and only vpn users can sub him up
Only like what 14 billion people living there

fbmess3 Although the door was closed a window was left VPN understood
alphaa2010 What do I get then
In factmost chinese dont know himbut there are many foreigners in china
YouTube

fbmess 3 Not really just use a VPN and dont get political
YouTube is ban

And under the ban of YouTube
fbmess3
Also wildly used as emoji in China social media
alphaa2010 aint no one subbing to your poor ass lil bro
fbmess3
killthedark7283 wtf
NUOfficial01 You ass hl

alimy nevertheless I am happily using the app now lol
NUOfficial01 That curse is specifically on you
Growing faster than Mr beast is wild
Uchihaclan2508 Sasuke are you from China
Seek Jesus and do as he says magic and luck does not exist it is all works from the Holy Spirit Jesus or God
NUOfficial01 man Ive seen this comment hundreds of times and that is not humanly possible after reading this comment
alphaa2010 well bro keep dreaming cuz thats the only way your playing your pc
killthedark7283 try Qingdao Hangzhou and Guangzhou Chongqing Chengdu the city where speed is gonna go
China dont know him
Please visit north Korea too
oH
NUOfficial01 yessir
They dont even know English they just wanna be in the video like zombies
killthedark7283 i assume connect to the world in your definition means speaking english and getting by Then in actual fact youre left with Shanghai and Hong kongMacau
China got huge amount of clips about speed
The first 5 minutes highlights watch it here
but in china you can use the technology to watch YouTube its very easy
But are Chinese people allowed to watch USA YouTube
i think in term of world wide popularity no one is above speed hes the no 1
and it also seems like ppl underestimate how many VPN users that can access YouTube like me in china the number is about 100200 million ppl
killthedark7283 nah its not about highest city tiers anymore i think in the scale of any second tier cities inchina there are VPN users
My wifes Chinese and explained how he went ultra viral because of the hilarious coincidence of him being shown the ni g song once I wheeze laughed until I was lightheaded and that is EXACTLY the kind of humor Chinese people show up in droves for
Ya i wasnt expecting it to have this much fans too
fbmess3
zhidaoyun you know what in our country has firewall we cannot use YouTube with usual internet we have to use VPN but personal use VPN is illegal and make VPN also illegal but we often it secretly mostly about speeds video or outsideinternetwe Chinese call it Translate directly from Chinese to English videos are all from person who was brought over from the outside intern
Uchihaclan2508but personal use or make VPN is illegal in China except companies can use or make it
alimy but many of us use vpn
If he knew he was so popular in China he probably would have been their sooner
Its not really because other cities are not attractive enough If you want to go to other cities they will also be open to you
actually use technology we can watch all of the app And vpn very cheap just 2 dollars Maybe somebody say it illegal in china But no one care it
alimy Someone reprinted these videos to Chinas Video platform
welcome to ChinaIts really an amazing place that will impress you a lot
alimy Grifters like you keep saying that but they know YouTubers like Ishowspeed Gtfo
alimy But we could useHongKong
he saidstupid Chinese in toiletbut he forgot turn off the microphone what he says is him true mindsNo respect No friends
killthedark7283 we have so much city are big cityGuangzhou is the top 3 city GDP in China
Yeah I subscribed youthen I unsubscribedIf you dont apologize to us your heart will be like your words NUOfficial01

It seems you didnt finish the stream completely
alimy but we are able to watch them in other places or use vpn
as a ChineseMy friend and I will watch him reaction to playing games live and his inexplicable expression We will be out of breath because of his laughter
A beautiful soul how could not be loved
NUOfficial01 get out kiddo

Whats your expect when his countrys propoganda has been working for 50 years
First stream was so tamed compared to Chengdu Chongqing
YouTube
NUOfficial01 thats somalian right idk most of it but its basically saying subscribe to channel
fbmess3 nojust government think
NUOfficial01 Please stop
GOATX2EDITZ7 Your qualityAwesome
0 out of 10 for real I think the translator is an ABC or something it seems that he doesnt know how to speak Chinese very well I am Chinese and I think even I can do better than him
bro as a chinese i have to say this pink level is fk dogshit
his name
Should have just used Microsoft Translator app
He is suck not only in English but also in what he treat others
translator was 110
same feeling about this that translator is just so awful
Isnt that orange hair
As a Chinese Im so uncomfortable for this pink guy rude not respect the locals
overrated translator
Why are you even giving the pinky 510 1 at most
Soooo true bro
010 that pink guy is full of bullshit
Youre speaking the truth brother
im not watching the whole thing but what did the translator do that makes him so bad
So TRUEEE And his translation was high key rude the whole time especially to workers when ordering
No respect at all fro workers and super rude as well He cant even speak chinese
httpsyoutubecomwildai2025siWH8mxxTLAqTjYr
Indonesia is the friendliest
Yes welcome to China Its very inclusive
Im curious what does your avatar mean
kerhabplays nazreal is crazy bro
shy my English is not good enough to express something not shy
All Asians who dont know English just smile and nod at any action its not shyness
Love the profile picture brother What part of the internet are you coming from
Yea you got the point lol
This is what called sterotype Chinese ppl is also open fun and creative
every Chinese family told us need respect each person that respect may lead to foreigner think we are shy
welcome to chinabro
Love this comment and a lot of people said the nice people on YouTube are the sponsored to be friendly Lol
Im a Chinese and Id like to kindly ask you what was your impression of China before that From the perspective of a Chinese Western countries have long been modernised and there is still a big gap between China and the West I want to know your true views on the comparison between China and the West Thank you
Even the remote parts of the area are super warm
Just remeber that no drugs in China
thank u
You dont have to worry about safety when you come here
but your country is always at the hostile side towards China since 1840 We Chinese remember this
Enjoy ur days there bruh
ricohu1160 Hahaa well thats the western propaganda striking again My account is old as hell so I feel like its verified enough to be a non bot response Feels like Im shadow banned by Youtube ironically from replying to half these comments tho Sorry zhixuanzhang6872 my long response is getting deleted or glitched somehow

The VPN market in China is very large

The worlds largest VPN market should be in China Even if there are still people who dont use VPN some will move to Chinese platforms like TikTok
trystanee1hc vpn
lightsxxdeath9116

Moodezsucksatgaming 666 i keep posting videos on yt for 7 yrs its all safe

punchmanager1536 I never know YouTube can blocked our comment 1 year ago Im confused why my comment always disappear When I read your comment Now I know why my comment always disappear Thank you because you give this information Sorry if my English is not good
Masahiroriki its ok man this thing happens to a lot of people who use youtube automatically it removed for no reason
Masahiroriki like it or not its called democracy
Singapore was as good too
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
rickz627 whats wrong
Bc we dont have liberals
punchmanager1536 I dont have beef with Poland and I have a positive attitude to ur country But what u did in the comment r ruining this
C4rnagen8u okay you want me to apologize
punchmanager1536 nope u dont need to apologize if u dont think u r wrong We Chinese dont have that attitude But yes again Ive little bit changed my mind about Poland But thats nothing to u guys right After all were just developing country
Speed fans in around the world are same
notforeveryoneF and it is just part 1 Chongqing will be crazy Speed will et so Lost there but it has its advantages since the city is so confusing Fans wont be really able to track him
Best quality stream of speed ever
I think this is my favorite stream so far of ishowspeed Enjoyed literally every second of it and felt so immersed and amazed by china and like all the people even though the police part at the end kinda ruined the vibe but it was so good overall best part was when he reached 37 million subs
junxifu2708 He definitely should get a Chongqing local guide for thator theyre gonna be sooooooo lost
Welcome to visit China
well it was mostly planned most likely all the random shit was probbraly nto so random and pre organized to happen
the goverment the people chill
xwyuo for my country its due to having Chinese dispora and China is very interested in the Caribbean region as well as some in some African regions
This seems quite clearly like botaction Chinese username not a problem on its own but then pretending like you havent seen China with your own eyes at all Account made 3 days ago Probably also an AI profile picture
handsome008 hey man Im from South America but I grew up in the Netherlands Suriname a former Dutch colony has some people from Chinese dispora most are from South China I think they are called Hmong and they speak hakkan maintain their culture food and religions many of the Chinese brothers and sisters own a shop or restaurant there are also a new wave of Chinese immigrants but the took Mandarin and present day things from China
10 China is now visafree for 10 days and welcomes to play
lifeifanj3i Do you know more and more China people living China to live oversea You can see more and more China people living in Thailand Singapore Malaysia
both can be true the gov can be iffy but the locals and culture is nice
A city of over 20 million people and not one piece of trash on the floor
Japan to Japan nobody no ishowspeed
RLhv3lb in japan they just straight up ignore him u called that respectful
lil4thatsme respectful doesnt mean u have to show your attention to everything in japan they have different cultures and theyre introverts they dont open doors for each other there and have private sections for most stuff because theyre not social
ravenw4695 and you all glaze China so why no glaze Japan
veyra0808 yea i get that but it just not as much fun uknow for streaming n shit
punchmanager1536 China doesnt need glaze speed went and we all saw its a W stream while yall glaze japan too hard but ignoring the bad side of japan what a clown
RLhv3lb Speed wasnt nearly as famous as he is today when he did that stream
veyra0808 and theres no vibe anymore yes
japan has its own vibe being loud and open and extroverted is not only vibing every culture has their preference if he dont like the introvert vibe then dont go to japan
Thank
veyra0808 ignorin aint mean shit too bruh
beluwuga once they go russia or paris they will see true ignoring
And alot of racism
This comment aged poorly lmfao Im not complaining though big crowds are the highlights of his irl streams

Politicians dont want people to get well with each other

You are right
True any high school student in china is better than him
YifuWangm1h dam China looks really good the propaganda over here crazy
MasterChief968 hes just saying how bad that translator was chill
MasterChief968 why you mad China is superior Coping isnt good for you bro
MasterChief968 Is a meme in china and you have no clueonly shows your lack of understanding of chinese internet culture
YouTube available in china
johnc1873 hes just saying the propaganda from other countries about China is crazy so he was supporting China
Iamjayy It is not available in mainland of China
Iamjayy nobut well find a way to figure it outwho doesnt like youtube anyway
I think he was just trying to stir up drama for content or something with ridiculous translations
Iamjayy how I talk to U I living in Beijing
Iamjayy yeahjust need some special ways
MasterChief968 They were just saying the truth Whats wrong with you What kind of shit is in your mind
we can use VPN
what type of VPN
Chinese people are so respectful
People say China is a dangerous country what a lie its the most developed country in the world its clean safe nice citys and Chinese food is some of the best itw and China has alot of western European culture in shanghaiAmerican culture and to access Internet use a vpn probably
Many media outlets spent a fortune smearing China but a blogger easily erased their negative influence on China with a single livestream
More and more people have begun to truly understand China where there are beautiful cities kindhearted people and a united nation
China is currently better than any country in this world bro 6 hrs stream without even lag is crazy and people are nice too
its a delight to see people know more about how good China is I can proudly say I am Chinese facepurpleraindrops
The China haters are fuming Speed is debunking all their propaganda about China in 6 hours
Ishowspeed in other countries 3 to 4 hours Ishowpeed in China 6 hours straight
We got ishowspeed in china before GTA 6
32623 view is just amazing as not only as indian anyone has to accept the technological marvel china has done
Speed is literally uniting this World unlike any political figure in history

Hello to the Chinese in the chat from Florida USA
Billions of dollars of antiChina propaganda down the drain after 1 livestream
What a modern technologically advanced peaceful country
W China W Chinese fans From Trkiye
Speed is trash go cry about it
3q thank you bro
No no no we are a developing country
Welcome to China bro We have nice people inclusive culture delicious food and so on
Thanks and have a nice day
Hardware is good enough Software have to upgrade
You are wrong There is a very developed Mandarin Internet in China which can produce enough entertainment products every day so Chinese people dont need social media from the United States and the West because they are not Mandarin Chinese people themselves have a Mandarin Internet community of 14 billion people but this is not On behalf of the Chinese they know nothing about the English Internet Of course people can receive information from the English Internet Just like you saw in the live broadcast there are many speed fans in China If it is completely closed why will there be speed fans in China Chinese people just dont like to go to an Englishspeaking and very antiChinese Internet entertainment Its not that they cant go but they can actually go
Def not as restrective as I would have expected according to this stream
big gap between shanghai and other cities bro
thank you bro u are right
well see in the upcoming streams
One problem I have to pay a million USD to get a 1 foot square space
Welcome to the real world

Shanghai Chengdu and Guangdong are the most inclusive regions in China If you go elsewhere it might not be as good
Welcome bro

Aminoacw6e

Aminoacw6e not true they have 50 cities like shanghai 50
Aminoacw6e qingdao changsa chengdu xian and some 40 more are all cyberpunk
Sorry I am Canadian
Then thats so good
tf3669
Breakfastststst It is very difficult to unite because Japan and South Korea are allies of the USA If South Korea and Japan want to unite with China then South Korea and Japan must leave the USA alliance and that will certainly be very difficult
Welcome to China
Welcome to China
coffeemountain381 Dogs are lives and chickens ducks fish geese pigs cows and sheep are also lives If you are not a complete vegetarian you have no right to criticize anyone who eats meat
coffeemountain381 You didnt answer my question straight up What are you hiding from and avoiding If you care about life not just animals well plants have life too and even the tiny critters in the air are alive You might as well just stop living then or else youre hurting life Dogs can be pets but there are folks out there who keep pigs cows chickens ducks and sheep as pets too How come its okay to eat those but not okay to eat dog meat Ive got a dog myself and I dont eat dog meat but Im not as extreme as you Its just about whether to eat dog meat and youre making it all about the country society and people Youre just being biased Stop acting all high and mighty like youre MrMs Righteousness here

And thats too with VPN right
Yep 6 hrs of stream with 2k quality
Clutcch China has the best internet
yes 5g is speed to 2000MB 30x faster to US
Just made me realize that this was 1440p on mobile internet and VPN Thats actually crazy
caiopoggers yoooh broin a few years you will find that other countries have not even popularized 5G while China has already popularized 6G
Because this is Shanghai my friend the city with the most advanced hardware in China other places are not so advanced
In fact Chinas network services is also the most costeffective in the world
Go live there then bro lmao
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
rparinpuia3678 yes bro I am answering your comment in the most remote rural area in the northwest of china
This is 5G network baby
You can call china is a futuristic country so dont understimated the technology in there
They are testing 6g already
In fact no need vpn
Its 2025 now and I cant believe there are network delays in other countries
x4n then you will say this is Beijing Shenzheng Guangzhou Nanjing Hangzhou Chongqing chengdu
rparinpuia3678 i would say yesMy internet is way faster in China with a VPN than it is in Australia
Im a Chinese and Id like to kindly ask you what was your impression of China before that From the perspective of a Chinese Western countries have long been modernised and there is still a big gap between China and the West I want to know your true views on the comparison between China and the West Thank you
China is just a developing country
Welcome to the real world away from fake news
Speed is also serving as a good ambassador showing China that we are not all like Trump and his cult of followers
0404DcT it is so sad how Trump is hating China so much
The amount of them fuming on twitter is real fun to see and even more people laugh at them
How is that possible
people mountain people sea
and this is just the first day
I think its because he wants to reach 37 subs
Korea Literally 5 hours in a half
cuz the city is very big and walk alot
because the zombie was on small pack and not aggressive
China is huge country man
lmaoin Shanghai6 hours
Chinas internet support is crazy bro its top notch no other country can beat china internet quality is reason why speed could do straight 6 hour stream with 2k Quality
dharmawiguna3232no because the internet quality was very good better than any other country speed has ever been to
Cause Shanghai is Massive
thailand 6
What was your mission in Shanghai
This stream looks like its sponsored by Chinese higher authorities everything looks so preplanned and even the randoms coming seems like they are intentionally there at that moment unlike other countries where the stream are absolutely random
Bruhh internet quality in China is super dope as compared to all other countries
zzyuk814 I thought too much If it was sponsored by senior management there would definitely be no such plot as Kobe Black Tea He is a pure Chinese meme
zzyuk814 Stop your conspiracy theory Its really boring
W but L politics
Youre a kid what do you even know about politics
Quackyduck47 uh I might look young but Im in my early 30s and as wise as anyone
xclny talking about the original poster that commented man
DivaDistrict like seriously imagine thinking American politics jobs are to unite the world like bro use your brain
xclny btw what grown man in his 30s watches ishowspeed
Quackyduck47 Im so confused what the original comment has to do with American politics he said unlike any political figure in the world history I didnt know America is the only place with political figures
NRGODKING what person critizes people for what they like
Me a person wrote this comment not a robot so me Its obvious who
Quackyduck47 that Trumps America is making China stronger
Bro America is 1st everyone else in the world is just watching what we do Nothing on this earth gets watched as much as western culture Get real trying to twist words like this kid isnt from America
MegaLoboton explain whats stronger whole thread cant wait to see this
I think u got too excited
Quackyduck47 America is 1stBro Youre still living in the past
imagine thinking I even remotely was speaking on economics Im talking about the world leaders and most people around who sit and watch and discusses what Americans are doing Whatever they claim its always America but nobody in America sits around and discusses what the people in London are doing or what the people of Australia are doing Anyone outside of America sits around and eventually discusses America Is it that hard to comprehend Good or bad American is always the topic because were 1 everyone wants to be American so bad that other people from other countries come here Nobody from America migrated to chinarussiagermanySouth America or anywhere Very few in percentage do But most people outside of America wishes to come to America
wtcl8497 notice how everyone knows speed because they want to learn about our American culture Nobody in America knows who in china is popular Thats the difference Were 1 and the fact that you thought I was speaking on test scores or some bs realize that you jumped to your assumption and failed
Quackyduck47
what are you talking about Unity is so far hahaha
Im curious to how you feel about your stance now
why not chinese all great bro
At what cost
rezone010 Im Chinese and I dont even know what a social credit score is
rezone010 social credit is only western and European thing lmao watch how u spend your credit card because youll be owing thounds of dollars to the bank all your life
rezone010 bro thought to know China through western media
Nobodyo4z1 Social credit and financial credit are not the same thing if you borrow money from a bank of course you are going to owe them money why would you expect otherwise
woahder2989 would you be socially active if you had been in financial credit debt because you u can barely afford anything90 American real life storyWouldnt you be working 18hrs7days50 American real life story because your government actually dont care about you only people who act like they care about u is banks who want you to loan money from them you dont have any social interactions literally equals to bad social credit score almost or literally a modern day slavery Im sad for you people literally praying for you
Nobodyo4z1 but you know that this is how it works the entire world over right If you borrow money you should pay it back Friend family bank it doesnt matter And no need to be sad for me I am not sad for you lol
woahder2989 the thing is 90 of Americans can barely afford anything while the rest of the world can live and eat healthy even if they dont work for months without loaning a dime from the bank
woahder2989 you have no reason to be sad for me tho
Nobodyo4z1 China is much poorer than the US and still has a higher GINI coefficient And yes you still have to pay the banks back in China
rezone010 You still believe that made up BS
woahder2989 Chinese only loans money from bank if its for business If it was for basic living rights thatd be like American democracy
Nobodyo4z1 The poverty line in China is 317year In the US it is 14891year Impoverished Americans would need to make 47x less money to compete with the impoverished in China
flakeybuns i want to say thank you for clearing things up i will delete my comment
rezone010 this is bs mate
Its normal
Military service and discipline
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
woahder2989 and American Eggs cost 47 times more expensive than Chinese
The nail that sticks up gets hammered
simon211 if I can buy a dozen eggs for 7 cents in China I would be impressed but it still wouldnt change anything
woahder2989 In China there are no poor people in the sense as defined in other countries because these people all own real estate and agricultural land They plant crops and consume what they grow by themselves They have a limited amount of surplus agricultural products for sale which is why they are considered to have a low income However according to the standards of other countries they are consuming all organic and healthy food and they are actually landowners
China is the only country in the world that has a full elite education system People have insight into unexpected events on the road Chinese people are rational and will not fanatically like a stranger for no reason Saying hello is out of politeness
That is the beautiful thing about oppression and dictatorship
Dont have to go to a big city There are hundreds of cities in China and many small and mediumsized cities are equally wonderful Many small cities are even cleaner and more organized than big cities
If you want to experience exotic customs welcome to Xinjiang
If you want to enjoy the extravagant life welcome to Macau if you want to visit Asian Financial Center welcome to Hong Kong
Totally agree Suzhou Chongqing and Guangzhou are perfect really iconic cities
Why dont you talk about Yunnan
If you want to have entertainment 24 hours a day welcome to Changsha
really
You may not know that China has the worlds best 5G network and the best wired fiber optic network
It normal right
Even in most rural areas of China the internet is so welldeveloped
Chinas communication infrastructure is at the forefront of the world with basic 5G coverage in addition to uninhabited areas such as mountains and deserts Dont forget that Huawei has the worlds largest 5G patents
Because China 5G
But I need vpn for using yt
Isnt it a normal thing in your country
Isnt this a very normal thing
o8k Normal Do you guys have youtube
Its really normal in China
Welcome to China
revenant8061 yeah thats why vpn is invented Most young people have vpn
reportTypeIdsuffix 8k
stanlee1087 Xiaomi TV Master with dramatic echo effectfacegreensmiling
we have 5g all around the country
The fact they using vpn and still streaming at 2k live with zero lag is impressive You know how many people are torrenting on that same vpn
Lets why America hates huawei and went after it
Of course its huawei 55g soon 6g
o8k most of countries dont have this advantage my man haha
LonglivePRC Actually I was born in a desert region in northwestern China Even here the network coverage is still ubiquitous allowing me to stream for hours without any lag Though its just a small fifthtier city
LonelyblueWangc7k sure
MaoZedongofficial YouTube
In Chinayou can get a 5G service with 235GB of data traffic for just 2 per month
because yt is unlawful in China as same as tk now
LonelyblueWangc7k
b4t
even countryside have 4g network at least 5g in cities
we maybe will have 6G at this year China always keep moving
Thank For subscribe

He was just there for showing love and help Speed not money Yall so retarded in the chat
China is nothing interesting Bali is amazing
My parents said if I get 200k followers theyd buy me a highend editing PC for my Youtube videos Begging you guys literally begging
CHINESE PEOPLE DO IT FOR FREE BECAUSE SPEED IS OUR CHINESE FRIEND
today wasmy birthday but no subcribers
You probably one of the guys who spam pay in Speed chat without knowing he always pay before hand and if not he has his manager with him that will take care of it behind the scene
Most of our friends in China are generous Fr
Why everybody in chat always talk about pay
cyphusstanislaus thats why in South East Asia stream the girl paid for food instead of speed He just left without paying
tha driver on tesla is a nerd
Youre one of those mfs that be spamming pay pay pay smh
Even if it seems like speed isnt listening to him much the experience alone should be enough payment for the driver
Daveteo7790 Im from Iran What glazing

1434 Speed IM ABOUT TO TRY CHINA KFC OK Chinese people Translator CHINESE VERSION Chinese people
I am big fan of chinese people They are so humble and dont meddle into other peoples businesses Love from Bangladesh
From street cleanliness to internet speed It seems that the Chinese government is the best At least they spend money on the people
Its insane how big of a fanbase hes built overseas good for him
I hate this translator the one with pink hair is impolite he dont even say thanks after ask somebody question and the way he treats people is very aggression like force them to answer or give them an order he dont know respect
Pink haired translator was doing nothing the whole time
Chinese seem polite peaceful ppl and clean streets no beefs If China becomes the superpower i hope they stay humble
I planned to go to china this summer after watching his streems every year we went to Europe for the summer but china seems much more fun and interesting we are coming china
good internet clean city nice and respectful people 100 better then any other country he went to
China is such a beautiful country full of respectful people I hope the USA and China can be at peace with each other one day
China is awesome bro the people the city no lag great country for content creators
1956 Speed still remember about indonesia
In China you never see the junkie or homeless in downtown This is a problem that the United States has never been able to solve
Chinese people reading the comments like wow the American actually likes us and Americans got to see the real China and said wow theyre actually cool af W for everyone in the end Shoutout to
in china one people only 200 can eat a whole month home cook rice meat vegetable bread milk everyhing and young people work and do business many all enough use i think its good and young people buy house all before 30years old around 27 28 young people can afford buy house some is around 35buy house put down payment and pay monthly and living good in china
China is fucking amazing Encourage everybody to go in person The countrys the size of fucking europe So much to see and do People are welcoming as fuck too
welcome to China
I agree I drank too much of the kool aid from the USA propaganda machine I had to visit China myself Literally no comparison Maybe Las Vegas strip
china is pretty chill and stable country tbh
i wouldnt say its greatest country but it has Done a good job lifted 800 million people out of poverty and the day is getting better its still a developing country and we hope most people here could live a higher quality life like people in developed country do

JENNIEKIMSWORLD Whats wrong with Vietnamese people and farmers Arrogant and discrimination wont get you far
Shanghai is as expensive as in new york
A lot of those kids are international school students
Literally talking about the 2nd richest city in Asua
Only because this is the richest city in China and there a lot of rich families here It is not strange
because its Shanghai
the west has fallen or it always has been
houses in shanghai are more expensive than Manhattans
Shanghai is the most prosperous super international metropolis under the direct jurisdiction of the central government Theres no wonder
Because they are
thats in Shanghai the richest city in China
China is just a developing country
Because this is Shanghai just like new york in the United States and Tokyo in Japan
Thank you for your love brother
except for their government i think always illegally invading other countries and taking territory and claiming they own it just like what they did to West Philippine Sea and now the even harassing small pilipino fisherman there
thank you
blackdeen9v Philippines The pariah state LMAO The territories belong to China China does not invade any country OMG
thank you
blackdeen9v why not you tell this to USA trying to invade green land and Canada
Agree some ppl would say Chinese are shy but I think humble is more appropriate
blackdeen9v Do you know the history of the Philippines Its invaded by the USA before You should check Google American Colonial Period 18981946 Thats why theres still today the US soldiers in the Philippines Any Chinese soldiers there Absolutely zero So who is harassing who is very clear
come and see one day always welcome to everyonetrophyyellowsmiling
NIUNIU902 whos that
mynameistriplew am asking the same thing
mynameistriplew Sunshine rainbow little white horse
Its to gain face not for the people Lmao
PeterControl wtf hahaha
PeterControl I hope you feel the same way about Japan
South East Asian countries are similar
PeterControl Wow this is actually a very interesting comment It means that your government gives you neither cleanliness nor face Feeling sorry for you
PeterControl Thats so true but plz remember we are still a developing country u cant compare our country to urs
PeterControl Theres a joker here
Welcome to the real world away from fake news
yanuuRqf4wv no one cares about your comment
PeterControl Being Taiwanese is not Chinese lil bro
Do they use face this word for that meaning
Only in the places youre allowed to look at its an interesting approach I guess it works for the majority of people who wont look into it
PeterControl your speech is as dark as your heartits hard to imagine how bad your life is
PeterControl the grape is sour so are you
qinglin4554 the towns arent cities the towns are poor tho and the the quality is all people alone not the government brother
PeterControl I can understand your jealousy
yeah PeterControl
Yeah they do everything to improve they peoples lives unlike certain countries out there
yoda5986 China is way better than US at least got way better lifequality
PeterControl It seems that some countries dont care about either face or people
PeterControl According to your logic your country doesnt even give you face
PeterControl what does the US govt do for yall
PeterControl did you go to China before If you didnt just dont say that
gain face for the people theres nothing wrong with it Hope your government would do it for you but maybe youre not so lucky PeterControl
PeterControl Havent the people benefited
to be fair his aggression is just reflecting speeds energy its not a formal government level meeting
thesmokeycloud so what
punchmanager1536 so i said what i said Can you read
thesmokeycloud Its polite to say excuse me before asking a question even in english bro what are you on about Translator just aggresively asks the question like hes shouting No excuse me or thank you at all It doesnt matter if ur sincere its common courtesy
I am not discriminating but in China a normal man cannot dye his hair pink
FOXKING very hard to get hired if you dye your hair like that
he is a gud translator wdym
coffeelord6394 speed wasnt saying excuse me either What are you on about
thesmokeycloud Most proffesional translators will automatically make things more polite even if the original speaker didnt say things politely And the polite part applies to getting the persons attention THEN relaying what speed wanted to say No excuse
thesmokeycloud no manner doesnt mean energetic u fool Dont reply me I am just a guy with full energy to share
Yes Very commanding And he is gone when he is needed many times
coffeelord6394 wrong he wasnt even a professional translater They didnt hire one And he was just saying what speed says A translater for an informal stream doesnt add words If you have a problem with that thats because speed himself wasnt being formal
Horrible
coffeelord6394 The translation software I used may not have conveyed the meaning clearly What I mean is that in China serious people dont dye their hair pink
coffeelord6394
exactly
Welcome to China
Not big deal the important is the respectful crowds good internet good activities no racist thats the important for stream
Theres always one bad thing in speed stream so not big deal
He was just watching on behalf of the government
yes I agree with you
Yeah it was nice to see that Speed wasnt getting swarmed by the crowd
Pink hair is impossible to enter government work how can it represent the government
in fact he was doing negative things all the time
redsoxfox4447 The main reason is that the pink hair is unqualified talking to passersby in a commanding tone and Speeds polite remarks are also translated into very rude words
akal3s So for you who is more good PINK GUY vs SUIT GUY
China is still a developing country and we know that there are still many shortcomings We will try our best to become better and more inclusive and welcome foreign friends to visit China
We wil be better we should be better and we will be better with other countries together
Just wanted to point out in the long history of human civilization China has been a super power 90 of the time
u know what i think CN people is the most humble people in the worldthey love peace
they are THE superpower already haha We got mind influenced by you know where
Bruh i forgot u guys got ur own slang Beef in slang means argument So no beef means we are saying ur country is nice and harmonious
We as a whole are VERY good at selfcriticism SO
Humble is part of our culture you need to be humble to be part of the society same as our country
it means no fights and people arguing with each other my brother from another mother
China is already the superpower as you can see yeah Chinese people are always humble for thousands of years already since time immemorial China Number 1
China is all about nothing else but being humble for the past 5000 years in its history
Better come before June cuz theres summer holiday after June and it will be very crowded
oh wow thank you for the information I planned it in august but if its crazy crowded i might just change it to fallwinter do you think it would be better
Deemr8y I think autumn is a great time to visit China During this season places like Jiuzhaigou in Sichuan and Suzhous gardens for example the Humble Administrators Garden are especially picturesque Even ancient Chinese poets often celebrated autumn in their works
Caelumv8f sorry I didnt receive notification for your response idk why but thank you so much this is really helpful
This stream looks like its sponsored by Chinese higher authorities everything looks so preplanned and even the randoms coming seems like they are intentionally there at that moment unlike other countries where the stream are absolutely random
zzyuk814 Stop spreading this bs see his other streams they are all very similar if it was state sponsored we would not be scared of the police at the very end Stupid guy spreading misinformation
zzyuk814 Its normal for games to have some business partnerships after all China has developed business and domestic netizens have tons of advertisements not to mention SPEED
Beside Japan and South Korea
zzyuk814 You look like the smartest guy in the world
AntiBollamumu idk what you saying bruh just love and and respect to you my Chinese sister
zzyuk814 Preconceptions in the human mind are a mountain
zzyuk814 Maybe MCNbut the goverment will not
zzyuk814 please understamd that china is huge countryand the government has a lot of work every dayso they are not interested in interfering in speed travel
Dont copy this nonsense anymore
zzyuk814 this comment is the biggest joke i see today
zzyuk814 ive been to shanghai in 2019 that time shanghai was smiliar to this but with time everything changes right

Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
We r not evil We r just people Peace n love from China
Save hope with you
You havent go to the west of ChinaYou just see the best place in ChinaWhere are you fromI want to ask a question
Vollkommen101stop cheating You are not American at all
Jamesi1o6z How am I not American
i mean communism did include everyone getting money even though if you did not work
Thats Socialist bro
To be honest there are indeed homeless people but not many Getting a job to fill ones stomach in China is still very simple and there are even fewer drug addicts Drug control is very strictAn ordinary Chinese
ChenxiM homeless homeless homeless homeless
Its simple they will arrange a meal job for the homeless

This stream has changed my views on China as an American
you realize not only Americans from outside China are on chat right He is watched all over Europe and world
It seems that the Chinese people really dont appreciate your comment which really speaks volumes about their culture and country as a whole As an American I respect them of course but it seems theyve been thoroughly conditioned to care less about what an American thinks of them I suppose thats just the price you pay when you grow up under communism instead of the free world
Cant agree more LOL
Valid909 Does what Americans think matter Why America owns the world
Chinese people welcome all friends who are friendly to China Your remark seems a little gloomy and selfdeprecating
lovely comment
MJmk1zidk why are u start get into an angry mode lol I as a Chinese feel ashamed when u are saying some shits like this attack comment clam down lad
Fire that pink hair dudeHe cant even understand and tell the right thing
the difference of the stream of speed between india and china shows how much the same population country have dfferent states
This pink translator is extremely impolite in Chinese traditional culture he even pointed at passersby arrogantly and didnt say thank you after asking questions The Chinese phrase get out of the way he taught Speeds bodyguards is also very impolite It should be please make wayjie guorang yi xia
after that korea stream this is the best irl streamand china is so lit
HIS POPULARITY IS INSANE IN CHINA OH MY GOSH THE PEOPLE ARE SO KIND CONGRATS ON 37MILLY
Chinas beauty lies not only in its stunning landscapes but also in the kindness and hard work of its people
No matter what anyone says China is the world leader in technology There is no other country that can even come close I also love Chinese architecture They are very smart in math No matter what the media says most of the technological devices we use in our homes are from China Thats why I respect China
Speed underestimated his popularity on the Chinese Internet and also underestimated the openness and vitality of Chinese young menThe first day of live broadcast is so fucking interesting Looking forward to tomorrows live broadcast Im so fucking love itbro
China is beautiful and people are too much kind Love from Nepal Please speed visit Nepal soon
Shoutout to the professional bodyguard Big guy has a big heart
Fire that pink translator guy he has made tons of mistakes and he seems not know Chinese very well
this proves that china is ahead of everyone the stream didnt even lag the internet is faaastt
China is awesome People there are so nice good energy Beautiful country
4252 nah that was too funny 11359 bro trollin too much 11926 kid is a legend but that coulda gone so wrong 12810 W ASS VIBES 14043 W old man 22025 we bout to fight also the coolest moves anybody could do 22947 bro so unserious 23232 BODIED HIMMMM HAHAHA 24557 bro took his sweet ass time 25451 LMFAOOOO that kid was outta pocket but I died laughing
Chineese people are very respectful
Chinese people are really too friendly My greatest wish is to become a Chinese local
Chinese people are wonderful people
There is no need to be so serious about bodyguards China is ridiculously safe
China best country respect to them First country not yelling like crazy they talk to him calm they let him Walk I like that fan have more interaction like this Respect
thats crazy i thought no one gonna recognize him because this is China internet is crazy
he maybe a rich secondgeneration relationship households
hongyee5d
Yeah Speed need to hire a serious professional translator
if you were able to size up the guy trust that Speed already sized up the extent of that guys power levels
xclny facepurplecrying
flakeybuns Speed just need jakenbake he would be perfect he also knows everything about China and what places are good to show stream
Right I swear Speed can never get a translator that can actually do the job Its frustrating
Honstly speed could surely find a better translator rather than the pink hair one
yes so many mistranslation
i can even do a better job than teh pink hair guy he got an attitude yet being so bad at translating
Yeshe translate so bad
no way this dude lives in China How u going to translate for someone and speak to ur own people like that and then go back to your life speaking to them again
jackson told him about the phrase as well but ig speed couldnt care less
Speeds guards are also very rude unprofessional trynaa behave like some hooligans
What was the Chinese phrase I didnt watch the stream
How many translators were there because I saw orange only
savageclasher1014 The pink hair one is so rude to passerby and his tone of speech is very firm and his sentence is alway short like a command
chanzhou5344 which pink hair
chanzhou5344 which pink hair
Id usually say dui bu qi or bu hao yi ci to get past someone
Speeds bodyguards are very rude So rude
But speed ever mentioned jakarta is the best stream so far 6 months ago am i out dated
luthfiaryadinataeffendi8314 he always say whatever country he streams in that its the best country he visitedim saying on behalf of my perspective
Naman77 fact
Poland was his best
luthfiaryadinataeffendi8314 thats because speed gets 1 million live viewers if we talk about vibes china korea and poland are still on top and are the best irl streams
luthfiaryadinataeffendi8314 in terms of content in general this one and korea are the best in asia streams tbh
luthfiaryadinataeffendi8314 he said because it is based in view count and subscribe countContentwise his best streams are this China one Korea and Poland tour
Yes he needs to go back in Korea
Poland still numba wan in terms of stream vibes
atrookie6465 agree bro Poland was the best irl stream imo even though im from Indonesia
Japan to bro
What do you mean insane He is a popular streamer but he not even close to a local small celebrity that no one in the west even knows exist
for real
Thats true
China is just a developing country
welcomemy bro
Thank you for your kind words I have a plan to go to Nepal next year
Plus his Chinese is impolite aggressive and rude
kellyzhan8058 he was more busy doing his own things lol but yeah his translation was like a 510 at most
yuzihua I am native Chinese speaker you have no idea how rude is this translator
junxifu2708 so many talented qualified Chinese English speaking people are there and speed just picked this one
kellyzhan8058 even the unicorn was better and way more polite
kellyzhan8058 off topic do you also get notifications about people liking comments and or replying to comments since for some reason I only get notified about it but it doesnt show up for me just trying to fix it so I can read replies as fast as possible
kellyzhan8058 He has pink hair maybe he is just what we call edgy
kellyzhan8058 omg I cant even imagine the image some people he talked to will keep of him theyre probably gonna think he was rude asf poor speed
i want so bad That ishowspeed try the advanced technology by HUAWEI like HUAWEIs NEARLINK and HUAWEIs Kunlun glass and HUAWEIs Car and HUAWEIs Share with Hands and HUAWEIs HarmonyOS NEXT and HUAWEI mate xt tri fold and HUAWEI pura x HUAWEIs technology is soo advanced no other company come near Even deepseek Usess HUAWEIs CPU and HUAWEI will make HarmonyOS pc HUAWEI doesnt just survive the ban but they destroy the bad and every company is shaken i wonder when ishowspeed will know this But he is a good guy cool and kind we need that
kellyzhan8058 ik cause i showed it to my gf she is Chinese she told the same thing that translator tone or smth was rude impolite
junxifu2708kinda same here I got no notifications for likes and several comments replied
and he was rude
No other countries dont have a lag either and Chinas internet is not fast
Danielp00j2i Come on what happened to the live broadcast card in Bolivia Isnt it normal for the whole 6hour live broadcast to be stuck In China
yulio6h That doesnt mean China is ahead of every country You prob saw some nationalist post in your internet but literally no one shocked having no lagging is completely normal
Danielp00j2i Are you sure Dude how long have you been entangled by the information cocoon of the Internet I have been in many countries around the world It can be said that China is the best and most united country I have ever seen The people here are very friendly and united Dont be a frog in the bottom of the well okay You are so ridiculous
Danielp00j2i Dont pretend to understand if you dont understand the world
I dont understand your funny ass sounding language speak English
Danielp00j2i Which country are you from Have you come for comparison
Funny that only Chinese got triggered by my comment
JohnothanBacon your name is not john ching
Danielp00j2i Its not expensive to get a passport try to experience it for yourself instead of being jealous here you who have never been abroad in your life
FordLink you are jealous cuz you dont say China is best country ahahahaha yall are so funny
FordLink FYI majority of Chinese dont have passport so you just speaking for yourself lol Its called projecting
Danielp00j2i You should watch those channels that drive hundreds of kilometers and broadcast live even on mountain roads and the signal is still smooth and unaffected I guess in your country when you go to the bathroom your signal may not be so smooth
Danielp00j2i You dont even dare to tell others which country you are from Does your country shame you so much Lol
IMMLXg9h Yes and its terrible
go google which country has fastest internet China is def not on the list yet you proud of your slow ahh internet what a joke
Danielp00j2i Its not surprising Before watching this video the China you saw on Googles YT was still in the 1950s
lmao you clearly misunderstood my comment google it means look it up China doesnt have the fastest internet
Danielp00j2i soooooo Are you trying to be right Does that satisfy your tiny ego
Danielp00j2i The fact is there was no lag proving China does not have the fastest internet doesnt change that fact
Danielp00j2i there is no denying bro why r u being so pressed about this Compare this stream to others Crystal clear quality throughout not a single lag Watch his other streams its not the same quality and has lagged You just dont like china admit it
because another country dont care youyour are jokes
Danielp00j2i im american yet China USA rn
youre supposed to hate on chyna bro choina bad
Haunt888 nah bro W China
racist ahh country
they only showing love cuz speed is rich Lol
h00dpssy3ater Its not like that bro speed because that song is well known to Chinese fans This is their way of interacting without any malice
You forgot aksai chin many Indian soldiers die for that and you saying respect
l am Chinese Indian descentYoure right
ananyadubey5338 Why should the people bear the burden of military conflict
ananyadubey5338 what Chinese didnt do that thats not the common peoples fault
Pla really a paper army who doesnt recognise its martyar soilder lol xi
ananyadubey5338 SOLDIERS Not citizens Not Indian citizens or Chinese citizens Maybe learn some respect
ChinaIndia friendship is evergreen
Annindia first time know indian have chinrse blood peoplethats cool
SomnathMahatoc9w Lets find out what happened in 1963
willshe this is not pla its indian army jaswant sing who kill alone 300 soilder Lol pla Also there have so many fighter if i start writing then you brain will not be able to digest
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
areyousmart407
areyousmart407 eh its dependent the last time I was in Shanghai an old man straight up gave me Im singaporean and my British and French colleagues a couple free beers and told us to enjoy our day XDD
While obtaining Chinese citizenship is among the most challenging processes worldwide the notion of being Chinese leans more toward cultural identity than mere nationality
yes were friendly to foreigner
welcome lets grab a meal my treat
it might be safe but when youre famous like speed especially in big cities the crowding will get too much and everyone is scrambling to give him a gift or take a picture or just see him bodyguards should still be around to keep crowds in check
amindoqx yes we are both right
Is more fore the crowd
In Chinese culture speaking in such a loud voice on the street during this live stream is already extremely impolite
Other countries be like we got individual freedoms we can shout if we want with spit flying
Total opposite of India
oyakefire should be all world like this
Let Chinese passersby scream like crazy It wont happen China is the only country in the world with a full elite education system People generally have insight into things they know that this is an internet celebrity and has nothing to do with their lives and they also know that they will be filmed so they say hello and leave
then u rlly ignorant asf but its great u learned smth from speed There is so much western culture in china especially here in shanghai we legit be using the same shit yall use like we use reels tiktok youtube and all that Us international students also talk the same as yall in the us
VPN is very common in China
You gotta be dumb to think that
you are not understand us
Speed eat pork and acting like he dont know this is pork
brothere is shanghai bro
This is the internet
dont mind these people bro
Bro because there are 14 billion people in China some of them can watch YouTube with a VPN
China is not North Korea my guy big difference
So why do u think absolutely Chinese shouldnt recognize speed hes one of the most famous YouTuber in the world u probably have a prejudice against Chinese
is it set up
the song helps a lotbro
RexChour3h
i want so bad That ishowspeed try the advanced technology by HUAWEI like HUAWEIs NEARLINK and HUAWEIs Kunlun glass and HUAWEIs Car and HUAWEIs Share with Hands and HUAWEIs HarmonyOS NEXT and HUAWEI mate xt tri fold and HUAWEI pura x HUAWEIs technology is soo advanced no other company come near Even deepseek Usess HUAWEIs CPU and HUAWEI will make HarmonyOS pc HUAWEI doesnt just survive the ban but they destroy the bad and every company is shaken i wonder when ishowspeed will know this But he is a good guy cool and kind we need that
If you cant eat grapes say sour grapes shabi
china have their app like youtubehe are very popular in there
It is illegal to use YouTube in China people who use would got arrested
You think we Chinese dont watch YouTube Actually we know more about the world than other people in the world
We got vpn tho we do watch him on yt
vpn is illegal in China
come to China Ill show you lmaooo
YouTube is ban
Because of the false information and news you saw
cllemzsamvchelsea f China were to open up the use of VPNs in an allowed way would there still be a market for foreign social media platforms and for you
timzzz5429 China wont allow anyone to illegal use vpn
In fact Chinese likes to know the cultures of all parts of the worldIncluding small countries in Asia Africa and Latin America
You need know about China
blxndedd yeah you are right My entire school was so exited when speed came over here it was crazy
Give me the source otherwise its all bullshit
ru at an international skl
Actually he is famous in China And there is a certain group in China thats pretty obsessed with some Western youtubers Cuz we really wanna learn things outside of CN and make friends all over the world instead of being regarded as a isolated and evil country from the Western political propaganda
In China it is easy for you to access software such as YouTube and x 3yearold children can do it
UWUr4u Youre right Im using a VPN
bro his vid got translated to chinese n get posted on chinese social media dont ever underestimate internet
Arthurd7v4c
Nearly everyone in Shanghai uses VPN there is so much international influence in this city
blxndedd I wonder if Speed goes to Russia will there be many fans there too There are Russians in his chat
cllemzsamvchelsea from someone living in shanghai I couldnt agree more
cllemzsamvchelsea its illegal but the government doesnt ban it cuz if they do all the international ppl living here including me and all my friends would just leave there would then be an economic spike downword cuz most international ppl living here has money and are heavy in consuming losing that means losing a large percent in government profit so in reality vpns arent rlly that illegal
blxndedd Yes using a VPN in wealthier cities isnt an issue Even in smaller cities as people do not post anything that doesnt fit the norm ordinary people wont be investigated for no reason But It is still illegal it is just too many people are using VPN so there are too many people pending to get captured but they dont have enough resources to execute this law so police will only detain people who use vpn to do something apparently illegal for example someone who promotes anticommunism content
blxndedd Yepp using a VPN in wealthier cities isnt an issue Even in smaller cities as people do not post anything that doesnt fit the norm ordinary people wont be investigated for no reason But It is still illegal it is just too many people are using VPN so there are too many people pending to get captured but they dont have enough resources to execute this law so police will only detain people who use vpn to do something apparently illegal for example someone who promotes anticommunism content
Before coming to China some platforms in China had many speed slices
cllemzsamvchelsea Gaslighting Like people saying your parents make their cheese on OF
GeorgeFormani9t no lets change the character these are Your parents making huge cheese on OF and PH
GeorgeFormani9t no lets change the character Like People saying Your parents are making huge CHEESE ON OF
Martiandy
Martiandy so I really dont understand what your brain is doing
wellwe know u guys almost everythingbut u didnt know us many things
u realize they are able to ban vpns in china right but they dont because of income not because people are pending to get captured that doesnt make any sense I have been using atrill vpn very well known and definitely seen by the government and till this day we are still able to access it without any issue And we know they have the power to shut it off because three summers ago they turned every vpn off for 2 and some days
37 million followers you cant be serious
chinese platform dont ban foreign content but the foreign platform never let western see much good scenes of china many chinese upload videos in youtube but ther were banned because of politics
You know too little about China but you think you know a lot about it bro
That makes no sense Many Chinese watch YouTube and even more watch clips on bilibili and other platforms
The video of his fire was caught by the police when the game was broadcast live
The two bodyguards should get paid extra on top of their travel expenses and everything You can see the stress in their eyes when big crowds surround them but they handle everything well and put up with Speeds if I can name it constant protocol breaking random stops barkoffs and sprints Love how theyre balancing friendliness to not offend any fans or give Speed a bad look being aware of the surroundings keeping Speed and the camera man safe Respect to the random dude thats been stalking them and giving free drinks to the crew
As a German I want to move to China because China is safer and cleaner and also the people are so nice W China
What a country calme and nice people
W china what a respectful country Love from India
He did stream in Europe and America and his internet was cut off everywhere there but that didnt happen in China Even inside the subway tunnel is internet wasnt cut off China is amazing
Fire the translator he was saying bulshhhit
Rangkai is a very rude way of saying watch out or excuse me from bros bodyguards it basically means gtfo the way Who ever told them either is bad in Mandarin or have an alternate agenda A better way of saying it would be JieGuo or RangYiXia
the female fan at the end was a way better translator than the pink hair guy
45043 Na I felt bad for that girl bro
China is very safe and its people are very friendly The internet supported by 5G technology has extended its coverage to rural areas You are welcome to travel to China
10947 fun fact China actually is taught English in school and a majority of the Chinese people know English What youre experiencing is a cultural shock from them and confusion they might not have ever seen someone not Chinese come out with a big camera and cause people to follow them you know what I mean
Bro underestimated his popularity in China bro was constantly swarmed
The aerial photos of this trip to China especially the trip to Chongqing are so beautiful thumbs up
You know the Chinese century is here when Ishowpeed sing neige song in China with Chinese lol W China

China is the future just look his people and culture A real example of a good state and economy
54046 thats how Chinese people treat tourist respect
l4e I never heard of him
Why do you call him Hyperthyroidism Brother You know what it makes sense
Hello sirmay I ask hows life like in Germany I may go there in future
xiaozhan258 well you are right but it depends on which job you are working at
SleepyAlexOo hi Well life in Germany is ok but right now we have a lot of problems eg the financial situation safety apartment search etc But we voted a new government and we have to see how it turns out but overall life here is not bad How is it in your country
xiaozhan258 which jobs are good paid in China
BlackmythWukong24 finance job
HenryTompkins then tell me how China is
BlackmythWukong24 sry bro i dont know why that i cant reply u my replies will automatical delete
BlackmythWukong24 For some reason like economic goes down jobs salary etc young people here are not like western its like national ism i was scary for this circumstances they are hatred of each other even ey own people its not safety for you weather you believe or not im Chinese Gen Z im telling u the truth cuz this is ive been through now of course im happy to see you move to here but just mark my word when u move here for living some time sry for that English
HenryTompkins is it about the pressure on Chinese society
HenryTompkins no need for apologizing about english Well I know that China faces economical problems jobs salary because of the trade war But I didnt know that they hate each other Is that true or did you want to write something different I only want to live in a country where I can live in peace The criminality here in Germany is insane
UpgradedTitanTVMan67 yes buddy from everywhere the gov population salary depreciation young people need something to blame they cant blame the gov so they blame the issue towards elsewhere like foreigner businessman somebody who live better than u young people believe that only commun ism can bring us out of problem
BlackmythWukong24 im not tryna say different China is safer than other countries on criminality but i cant guarantee u when the society collapse its not safety for anyone its not far away for todays China when the people cant tolerate the poor salary and working long hours its the time
HenryTompkins that sounds terrible The same thing happens here in Germany whole Europe because of the migration politics and I am scared that far right people like AH come back I dont know how bad it is I am doing a lot of research about China because I dont believe everything what the medias say but I have the feeling that Germany is sadly moving back to 1933 what I dont hope It seems like that every country has problems
BlackmythWukong24 This buddy is telling the truth but not all if u r foreigner u r absolutely safe in China Societys hierarchy is an issue in China but as a foreigner u dont have such thing to worry about And because of the Confucian culture in China most of them are welcome and kind
BlackmythWukong24 the fastest and easiest job Ull get is language teacher and if u skilled at teaching High salary no doubt man
I am chinese I was in Germany for years Its more interesting and safer to live in china I support your idea because i know these two countries very well Das Leben in Deutschland ist etwas langweilig
xiaorenli6978 I think the reason why Germany seems boring is because the constructed culture of the NSDAP USA wiped out a clear lineage between the christianlatin culture and our profile nowadays Germany evolved into something like a framework like the USA Am half german half chinese
BlackmythWukong24 safety is a problem but a German from Koblenz told me its safe there I think every country is suffering from past covid and China changed economic development plans from focus on the speed of economic growth to quality development so its kinda slow down compared to earlier days but we always welcome skilled and educated friendly foreigners I think you will be paid well work hereand its very safe here
BlackmythWukong24 English teachers are well paid
HenryTompkins So what You must have never been here
TinaTT327 whatever
TinaTT327 okay so i already said u cant represent most of chinese tho
Bro language issues are a real headache
BlackmythWukong24 No country is perfect its important to view things rationally Some people like to highlight the positive aspects of their own country while others focus on the negative Thats why there are endless debates in the comment sections Some might have been influenced by Western propaganda and become doomsayers about societal collapse like the person you mentioned earlier But it cant be denied that young people today are under a lot of pressure after all with a large population competition is relatively fierce However how to relieve that pressure depends on oneself And as for harboring hatred towards others it might be because theyve experienced bullying in school or other issues that left psychological scars Also getting out of difficult situations mostly relies on oneself Good job positions have to be fought for by oneself right In every country
HenryTompkins Which country are you from
but bad government
EmmaZzz8964 ur brainwashed too deep son
EmmaZzz8964 ur brainwashed too deep son
EmmaZzz8964 Still better than yours Im sure
EmmaZzz8964 god bless u
EmmaZzz8964 14 billion Chinese likes the government dear
EmmaZzz8964 China is such a huge country its inevitable that therell be problems But honestly I think theyre doing pretty well already Most regular folks dont really pay attention to what the governments up to When it comes to poverty theyve managed to make most peoples lives decent enough to be happy
thank you India nicetoo
JoBloJo nahthey apparently changed their way later onthat way of talking can build Speed really bad impression to China
Obviously you dont need to remind them because Wang Jiaer has already reminded them
JoBloJo really You think its ok to yell F off to fans for no reason Its that heavy of a word choice
JoBloJo say more to your mother
JoBloJo
jakes750 you cared to comment Get a life
jakes750 who asked for yours Mind your own business kiddo
Kpop is life MULTIFANDOM IS LIFE TOO how ironic of u telling me to get a life
nah hes wrong it literally means move aside
sixtystrawberries as a Chinese I can literally tell you that rang kai is very rude
ye im also half chinese and speak fluently its rude but not like gtfo my way
you need to respect the people there rightIf a famous Asian YouTuber that you dont know streaming in your country and say get out of the way in very rude way to you in the street How would you feel
Rang kai is heavy in tone But crowded like that bodyguards is totally appropriate to say it
g1i literally means get out of my way which you only hear in cities with rude people like nyc
sixtystrawberries and its rude No polite person says that to a stranger its basically looking for a fight Its basically barging into someone saying Move it
Probably the Pink hair guy since he was with them all the time and didnt correct them until they met up with Jackson Wang
but basically we dont use it unless ppl are standing in the way without any moving even knowing theyre blocking Still a great difference sixtystrawberries
You speak rangkai to someone you dont knowthat means your ready for a fight
jakes750 yeah Jackson mentioned that 15224
sixtystrawberries go out
jakes750 nobody said this to you lil bro Its like saying why why this movie is made nobody asked like you know all the movies in in existence
jakes750 have you heard of When in Rome Do as the Romans do
Thank for explaning it
You can just say SORRY end of the story for sure
Not just the words Speeds bodyguards are soooooo rude
notyours654 meanmean
NGL speed hired a good strong bodyguards Even though China is a clam and beautiful place Mad respect for the bodyguards and the Chinese people They didnt even attack speed
The very opposite of india pakistan and bangladesh
Bro learned india from reels I am from rural area of India and i am using unlimited 5g internet from last 25 years in just about 45 per monthhope this helps you easternhelder
I visited India cant even send massages
theneetnibba9423 5G
Nahh he just talks too fast and him being american with the accent
Yes our English course is almost at the same level as ChineseBut there are still many people who learn badly enough such as me
i studied english in a chinese school for over a decade and considered myself spoke better english than most chinese citizens but I still had a hard time figured out what people were saying when i first I moved to the states
Teaching English does not mean that students can learn it My English is very poor although I have studied English for 12 years
Thats only mainly in Shanghai and other big tech cities go for exemple in Beijing which is a more traditional city and barely anyone speaks English there
and it is British English
He went to tourist attractions If hes around CBD things will be much better
Maskaguy7903 better than xqcL lol
The younger generation in China has been learning English since primary school However the training mainly focuses on listening and reading so many Chinese people struggle with speaking English even though they can read it well
Maskaguy7903 Speeds black folks in a very polite and respectful way accent is pretty strong
not really other Asian countries were much more crazy Considering Chinas population it wasnt bad at all
instaves true but China is also way more civil than Southeast Asia
Cause the cntiktok also has his video
instaves Since its a workday most people finish up by 6 pm
raspberryhibiscus Im chinese but I think you think too highly of China Chinese too much
zhanghua1998 yup they are glazing too much
instaves Everyone can see that Chinese fans are more respectful peaceful wellmannered and wellbehaved compared to other countries fans
I am not a fans but still alway want to see him in China so can compare
How many translators were there because I saw orange only
Yeah china is nice but not in the future
andropahsa3904 China is already in the future bro you can simply say this by seeing the internet quality china has the best internet quality out of all the country so clearly China is in the future
They are not good from hearts
Just wait for Chonqing the cyberpunk 2077 city Its gonna be crazzyy for speed
Benronix good for snakes
ARZEDXTS lol cheap mind wdym
andropahsa3904 man look the history since 3000 bc and less than 1 of poverty thats real impresive just think about it thats the real liberty country
jasonstevens2060 No freedoms These people dont look like theyre not free
christianjimenezcastillo3792 In the past thousands of years except for the Qing Dynasty China has always been the most powerful country in the world In order to stabilize their rule the rulers of the Qing Dynasty destroyed many excellent traditional thingsdid not allow people to read did not allow them to develop science technology academic research and destroyed them It was a dark and sad era
Benronix China is future because internet that is so dumb
that girl is from Harvard her family is the ruling class of China money is free for her unlimited
yoyozent wow dint knew Chinese elite were so generous thats great its better to give something instead of nothing I guess
In China there is no tipping If someone voluntarily helps you it means they genuinely want to help and do not expect anything in return
Chinese people is indeed friendly and Chinese city is cleanI have watched a lot of videos about Chinese cities They are all cleanI misunderstood china before
Hyperthyroidism Guy is what we call in English In Chinese pronounced as Ji kng refers to hyperthyroidism and pronounced as g is like saying brother or guy a casual way to address a male People use this nickname for Jason you know because hes super energetic and has big prominent eyes Its an affectionate nickname
Bro break the Western Propaganda about china under a day
11736 Big W speed to give them warning to dont vape
China is an ancient civilization that has endured uninterrupted for millennia The Chinese people are kindhearted and intelligent yet China has been consistently demonized by US and European media over the long term Through Speeds livestream broadcasts in China this time I witnessed firsthand the cultivated manners of the Chinese people and the impressive development of their cities
China is sooo clean and developed
W China From PT
All bullshit aside this content was exactly what we needed especially during this time with all this political bullshit this actually made me see China in a different light idk if China has really changed or if theyre trying to change theyre public image but whatever the case it made me happy seeing these fans happy to see Speed and him being a young black man is the extra on topnot gone lie i could never watch speed for to long but im deeply invested in this live he realt made me a fan off this tour right here this kept me purely entertained through my overnight shift at work and Ill be watching the ep 2 tonight as well and so forth
Thanks to China government for thier police the Internet and everything They care about thier people unlike se other countries
Brothers a large number of people are not allowed to stop on the streets of China because there was a stampede incident in 2014 Dont chase speed

China is a beautiful country welcome to China
Youtube isnt actually banned in China Youtube just chose not to operate there since they have strict privacy policies VPNs are also not illegal Your camera man shouldnt be so concerned about streaming to youtube its fine
Your video completely changed the views of those who dont know China China is really good
45454 Speed and them three guys went crazy
Damn I am jealous of speed living probably the best life on this earth While he was having a blast in China I was doing homework for hours straight in a room that no one knew my existence Crazy that he is my age
The translators were very poor and many friendly greetings were mistranslated
welcome to China in future
Dont be fooled China cant be that good I think it must be Korea

craftah Have you ever been to China How is your mandarin level
craftah
craftah Thats bc their population are 1 billion peoples make sense if the government made a hard rules
craftah You think you know a lot Look at a few videos on the Internet that smear China and take it for granted
craftah Bro never been to Chinabut knows more about China than we chinese
MaplinMa do i have to know mandarin and go to china to know about 1989 uyghurs etc have you ever been to some random village in China compare it with some random village in Switzerland or Norway
elewhite5873 Cognition is related to reading and experience
olvund so what dont you know countries have local governments each region and city can have people who care about it
craftah Oh bro know everything
craftah the Chinese never used napalm on children
Ok then you tell me the essential reason and whos behind this of 1989 A guy who has never even lived in China once claims to know Chinese gov very well craftah
depressing country
craftah they care enough to build better infrastructure to help with people getting to their work and education for really cheap
craftah at least they never bombed any country
craftah Which country are you from Let me talk about my stereotype of you
Maybe you dont know China The police in China are very good craftah
what about the Xuzhou chained woman incident
yanxxizxy what about
JuyiBaiy2b i can criticize my country
craftah Im sure you take what others have brainwashed you into thinking as fact
craftah you dont know anything about China
craftah There must be scum but we will feel safe when we meet the police in our hearts
craftah Bro think 1989 thing could represent everything about China
craftah You can criticize your country so what Do you country help to build infrastructure like China Do your critics work in there
14 craftah
Ill tell you a fact that you may not believe after I lost my bike i called the police in China but there was no result afterwards
craftah Then what What can be changed by criticism You dont even have the confidence to say which country you are from Its a shame
craftah And you know about CN govt by how from who Who put those stories about the CN government in your head Ever wonder how many of those stories about China are true
craftah bro acting like his own profile pic
craftah At least Chinas government is than Americas and Indias government
craftah Can you discuss racial discrimination Or PalestineOr RussiaI found out through the news media that in your country supporting such actions can be punishable by deathIs this true right
kkone7126 you dont know where i live and what you said is just funny
kkone7126 yes slovakia I can criticize whatever and whoever i want
yxi4176 i know you cant learn english because china hires russians and other nonnative english speakers but try to translate if you want to talk to me
Yes in Shanghai
Yea I heard you can get in trouble for public disturbance
Yes safety is the most important thing and the police are very responsible to ensure that people are safe and there are no accidents
Yeah they shouldve brought him to a local park people can gather there all the time and youd see grandpa and grandma dancing while kids running around even at night

Congrats on being the first comment dude
VPN is not completely illegal but have legal risks In this case It is against law since showing it to public Social impact is highly concerned by government
use VPNs is gray areaIts fine to use it privately by yourself
What are you talking about its actually illegal to use vpn in china but only if you do not do something illegal on the foreign website police will not go to arrest you
using vpn in china cause less trouble than drinking booze on the street of uk
Jamesi1o6z we have lots of Chinese VPNs here most are Chinese companies I used VPN for 9 years and still using it
You may know Liziqi who is the most famous Youtuber living in China So Youtube VPN are definitely allowed to be used in China But they just need to follow some rules
but its fine now nobody care about you have vpn bro i am Chinese
It is not illegal to use a VPN but it is illegal to create a VPN platform without the permission of the relevant authorities
VPNYouTube
Jamesi1o6z Bro its actually not illegal to use VPN in China But if you make some political statements on YouTube or move sensitive videos from the international network to the domestic network in China then it will have a bad effect And then the Chinese cyber police will find you wherever you are why can we use a VPN but the police dont arrest us thats because there is no law in China that stipulates that using VPN is illegal
there are benefits to being unknown
Not a lot of people could do what he does I def wouldnt be this entertaining and high energy Also being famous doesnt make everybody happy
whatispongebubdoin Speed is a multimillionaire at 20 hes set for life man
you are old enough to know thatthis world is not fair
Still a lot of people woudlnt feel comfortable doing what he does
art wouldnt exist if it was
malone4315 this world should be fair
Life begins at the end of the comfort zone
dont say that dont compare yourself to other man Find something that will genuinely make you happy in life
15227 thankyou Jackson wang for correcting a better word for speed W jackson jackson always in everywhere every country
Concerning the Chinese peoples friendliness I was in China one year ago with my wife I walked close to a family with 3 generations and was curious about the food they were eating at the park Surprisingly they welcomed me and asked me to join their food party Amazing people Im not a celebrity but they also treated me nicely
Its clearly more advanced and civilized than us
Many Westerners think that China is as closed as North Korea but in fact most Chinese are very aware of Western culture
IShowSpeeds trip to China has attracted widespread global attention
The old man who did a push up for the money was the sweetest moment in this stream 14041
this shit was so cinematic almost like a movie
Glad you are visiting China So many people misunderstand China in the west world
I think you also need to go to tier 3 cities and rural areas to see the people there then you can show China in a more comprehensive way
ONE OF THE BEST STREAMS W CHINA
37 Million on the first China stream
My homework is crying in the corner while I vibe here
China is an inclusive and safe country Welcome everyone to come to China and take a look You will find that this country is not bad
China the only country without zombies W
6 hours of stream is crazy
37 millions on the first China stream
Speed Sir I saw many of your videos recently and I have to say I am so impressed with how kind you are and am so happy young people really do have positive people to look up to I am so proud of the man you are Sir and this is coming from a semiold lady at almost 56 Im not used to seeing such kindness from young people and I want to thank you for changing that thought of mine Stay blessed and always be who you are
This was one of the best and longest speed irl stream W china

Chinese people are not racially discriminatory We love playful memes and slang but never with offensive intent In everyday Mandarin especially in Beijing the word pronounced ni ge is one of the most common filler phrases similar to saying um or that thing in English For example Wait I need ni ge my phone Wheres ni ge the remote control However due to its phonetic similarity to a certain English slur Chinese netizens sometimes joke about it in lighthearted memes or puns This is purely cultural wordplay and never meant to offend Were just having fun with language quirks Chinese humor often embraces linguistic coincidences but we deeply respect all cultures and communities If nonChinese speakers misunderstand were happy to clarify As a Chinese person I also hope our Chinese fans can avoid overusing memes inappropriately and maintain respect
ur so rude coffeemountain381
coffeemountain381 Hope you live in a civilized place A truly civilized placefaceturquoisecoveringeyes
coffeemountain381 OK bro this is an ordinary family gathering Do you use sewage oil oil for your family party And invite foreigners I think your assumption is very flawed thats it If I have offended you I m sry
coffeemountain381
Who on earth will use that Youre wasted the food its not even edible If you have food you can afford cooking oil
coffeemountain381
coffeemountain381 You see all this and you still fallback on your ignorance and what youre told to believe Your state has failed you in many ways
coffeemountain381 bad people will say bad words to everyone
we Chinese also have many problems to be solvedThe fact behind the advanced infrastruction is our unemployment and the government take debts to build thisjust like what Roosevelt did in 1930s in usa
HMSCheshire thats called investment If you build infrastructure it creates connectivity to have long term growth Its not about profit like in Western countries
Yeah its not like part of the population is in an internment camp or anything
thewanderer8438 Its not just foreign countries that have heroes If there really were places where people are persecuted local heroes and soldiers would have gone to rescue them long ago So this is clearly a lie
Still a developing country and has a lot of things need to learn from the us its a pity your gov treat us as threat instead of partner
Im chinese and its not really true because in the rural parts it is quite underdeveloped and with the crazy infrastructure comes the slums or old not yet demolished neighborhoods
RipProYT
China is just a developing country
RipProYT fake Chinese
something is seriously wrong with you
you need help man go to the hospital
go to therapy lil bro
I taught English on the internet to kids in China and many of my students were well aware of US politics TV movies music fashion etceven some of my students who were from Xinjiang in far western China The Chinese are amazing people
they are just closed on social media
There are also a lot of knowledge sharers on our local video sites like Bilibili which is similar to Youtube and we are also very interested in the culture and history of the West and around the world
surefrom rural China
This is not a good thing China has a longer history and a more advanced civilization The world should embrace the baptism of Chinese culture rather than China learning from Western culture As far as I know many elements of Han culture have already been discarded by the Chinese people due to an inferiority complex
Many people think that the wall is built to block our view to the outside but in fact its to prevent the outside from seeing inside while we peer out from the gaps between the bricks
Long live the great unity of the people of the world
Nobody thinks that
they misunderstanded speeds meanningat once speed want to simply give 100 and the old refusedchinese prefer do something to gain money
Thank For subscribe
In fact it is the problem of translation This translation is not very professional
LiuKenv9c nah bro one of his people said to the gramps to do a push up
The moment when speed hit his head in the bus
Snowball635 why do you have to call him old bruh
That lady in the bus was also sweet
If you give money directly to China people they may not accept it but if you tell them to do something to earn it they will be happy hhh
SpicedIce123 62 is considered old
LiuKenv9c nah the translator with pink hair said this
The translator is not good enough He cant explain very accurately so he lets the MR speed look rude
Nah bro the translation is terrib
That was mistranslation done by the pink haired guy
But some local Internet celebrity is watching SPEED live Then go find him offline and shoot a video for their own channel
I expected this to have a part 2 of it
what does w mean
The best one so far for me
Thats 37 lol
Its not blind ahh

1150 that dap
Theres something Ive always been afraid to say Ive found that theres a really serious problem with Hyperthyroidism Guy That is his Chinese isnt good enough and he isnt aware that the translator he hired isnt competent If you look closely every time Hyperthyroidism Guy interacts with fans and passersby he is extremely polite and enthusiastic He keeps saying thank you and will also ask for everyones opinions during the interaction However his translator has never translated a single thank you throughout The translator is very rude to everyone and even makes translation mistakes Hyperthyroidism Guy said This piece of clothing is nice Ill go and buy one in the future The pinkhaired translator said Can you give it to him Hyperthyroidism Guy said May I take a photo for you It would be my honor if I can The pinkhaired translator said Im going to take a photo of you Hyperthyroidism Guy said Chinese chili peppers are very spicy The pinkhaired translator said Auntie what are you cooking Even when Hyperthyroidism Guy was communicating with the children on the bus the pinkhaired translator just disappeared I never expected that someone as popular as Hyperthyroidism Guy still hasnt found a good translator No wonder passersby and fans have volunteered to be temporary free translators because theyre really worried that hell be let down by the pinkhaired translator I hope that in the future as Hyperthyroidism Guy gets better and better at Chinese and no longer needs a translator he can communicate his most friendly and sincere feelings to everyone

Well it a stream it has to be long
They used to run for hours on the savannah
I seen Chinese chat 100 times
Why are the Chinese people calling him Hyperthyroidism Thats sooo mean and rude
Viceqt lost in translation What really means is that speed is energetic
Viceqt hes behavior looks like Hyperthyroidismnot real Hyperthyroidism
Viceqt This word doesnt mean disease in Chinese context it means that he is full of energy and then plays crazy
Viceqt Because his live streaming style is very exciting which is a nickname for him
You know hes bad if he cant even translate numbers
waohishow speed travel china this thing in Chinese video app is very hotmy English not very good Im Chinese
He is a horrible translator
really inappropriate
Im concerned how come that they are 2nd largest population but they are not apocalypse
As a non Chinese thank you for your hospitality and I wish nothing but the best for all those amazing respectful and cheerful youth full of life I hope there are more moments like this stream for you guys to enjoy
Bodyguards are supposed to protect the people they are guarding Sometimes that means asking people to make room or move for safety It may seem rude but its part of their job It may seem rude but theres usually a security reason behind it If someone feels disturbed it can be seen as a protection aspect as well It can be controversial when bodyguards act assertively but how do you think they should carry out their duties without causing misunderstandings
Cant expect too much from these goons
yojhtiwxes r u African American
Its not part of their job to get in someones car and tell someone already sitting there to get out If people are approaching them fine do what you need to do But as they walk on the streets and tell people in front to get out of the way In a foreign language No Just no If people in front are blocking them then move around them the walk way is wide enough Not tell others to move Especially in such a rude manner with a cold face As for how to have bodyguards carry their duties without causing misunderstanding Either hire a local bodyguard that understands the laws language and customs or learn the local language on how to POLITELY ask people to make way Or at least ask people to make way POLITELY Not just move or get out of the way
crypty9365 no
yojhtiwxes In China we demand that everyone be equal Security guards are just ordinary people and have no right to ask others to do anything
yojhtiwxes When in Rome do as the Romans do dont make your own rule there
Agreed Really rude Not sure if Speed is obnoxious or those around him make him appear this way Telling everyone to get away is not acceptable no matter what job you do
His guards kept on saying Xiao xin be careful mindful to others on the road He and them should be more cautious and not bring trouble to others Stupid idiots
CatAdrina Yeh except they kept shouting it in such a rude and cold way while pushing people around Words mean nothing if the actions dont match it
Yyli123 For a celebrity that always gets surrounded by people bodyguards are still needed to make way for him to move
Bro yall dont see how many people crowding
beluwuga If you read on youd see that I was referring to people in front You simply dont push away people in front nor do you yell and demand them get out the way especially when they were just standing there They dont own the road You walk around them And you also dont get in someones car and tell them to get out Thats so rude
Speeds bodyguards are extremely rude They are in China not their country And that was public space not their own home And Chinese people are so friendly so nice these bodyguards are so rude and disrespectful
Dear IShowSpeed Im writing to express my sincere gratitude for your recent China trip and the live streams you shared with the world As a Chinese I was deeply touched by your genuine exploration of my country For a long time Western media have spread so much misinformation about China that many people around the world have formed inaccurate impressions of us But you with your unfiltered live broadcasts have shattered those false images You showed the world Chinas modern cities high speed trains with stable network connections even in tunnels the rich and vibrant street life and most importantly the warmth and friendliness of the Chinese people When you sang Sunshine Rainbow Little White Horse with Chinese fans on the street and when you were amazed by the Forbidden City the Great Wall and the Sichuan Opera those real time reactions were like a window allowing the world to see the real China Your journey across Shanghai Beijing Henan and Chengdu has presented a vivid and three dimensional view of my homeland Thank you for being a bridge between different cultures Your visit has not only let the world know China better but also brought closer the hearts of people from different countries I hope you will come back to China again soon and continue to discover more of its beauty and charm Best regards Your Name

is an interrogative sentence that can be translated as How are you but its not exactly the same Chinese people usually dont greet each other this way possible greetings include saying Hello or simply HeyHi Thats why when Joson says to others few respond because it sounds strange and people find it hard to react as for why that guy suggested using as a greeting I think he might have been nervous and misspoke
I hope this experience can make more people like the wonderful country

Translate bro
Bro
China is not good in finance beforethey just focus on their products industries
The United States has increased its tariffs on Chinese cars by 100 If you want to buy them you can only buy them from Mexico
Not just Elons fault Democrians would also charge the tariffs US would never allow Chinese cars selling in
forget about it200 tariff rightnow
Chinese EVs are currently failing Aus safety standards Id be careful

Chinese people are really friendly and hospitable They welcome anyone who comes to visit China Of course you cant do anything outrageous In fact wherever you go in the world you should abide by the local rules

Biggest speed irl stream and one of the best W china
The Chinese are respectful

Why the hell is the translator so aggressive He says things in such a rude and disrespectful tone

speed destroy the trumph vision in one stream
4551 shes kinda cute though
His Chinese fans are wild
China really needs real videos like yours to show

Yes bro Im a Chinese but its bad news to see reports about China abroad
i respectfully bro nobody thinks about you guys
USA hate China because the have better technology is crazy shit
This stream looks like its sponsored by Chinese higher authorities everything looks so preplanned and even the randoms coming seems like they are intentionally there at that moment unlike other countries where the stream are absolutely random
zzyuk814 I must admit that many plots have Chinas online celebrities and stars but it is also true Except for the arranged plots other peoples streets are random events which is the most real China
Welcome to the real world away from fake news
get away from propagandas of western
Too much fake news
Marriage market thing and the dancing girl are pre planned except that are random people
fake news too much
Were not told anything about China Your ignorance is YOUR fault
Hope you can go visit China one day You will not regret I promise you
He is going back to Korea
lazyjellyfruit71 Idk but hopefully
that is not a good choice dude
biology is boring
Boards
ong bro i woke up so early to catch the stream Im winded right now trying not to fall asleep during class
ur cooked
Bro is cooked
Good luck on your exams bro
v1u When they say chill they mean in attitude so like the people were more relaxed than the Western world which tends to be more loud arrogant and mean
i didnt say anything about LGBT or environmental groups if the translation is accurate they are chill too
Worth watching I just woke up
Speed is literally about to make streaming history with these streams
HOUSTONERS420 yea worth it
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
Probably a Taiwanese
MaverickD I am Chinese and Taiwanese are very polite Stop dividing the Chinese people taiwanese and mainlanders are one family SB
Anonymousgn7xk diss
So true and he the translator with pink hairs mistranslated a lot of things for example he told passersby to Shan Kai which means f off and when Speed wants water to cool down the spicyness he really doesnt care and pursues his own agenda In Chinese social media 100 of the comments about translation are scolding him
Well said brother
yea they even didnt care to learn sorry excuse me in Chinese How arrogant And Chinese dont saywe just say
Agree with you
she seemed to set him up to lead a nega chant lol I know she probably didnt know but fr she put the mic there right at that moment
AlanChenYL watch out
Ayoooo Im dying at these translations What do you call him the pinkhaired man and not his name
because he didnt worse any repecthe is a horrible translator Viceqt
is he not Chinese
watch out
Im telling you bro Viceqt
Goddamnit change the translator bruhhh
38get out the way
AlanChenYL These bodyguards are very rude and very disrespectful
Youknowwhoq4p these bodyguards are extremely rude and disrespectful Disgusting
Chineese people are really nice
That pink haired translator lacks quality Speed said to buy a piece of clothing and the translation directly said to give this piece of clothing to Speed with a domineering and absolute tone like a gangster
This live broadcast of your trip to China has shown many people who were unfamiliar with China the true face of this country China is a beautiful land home to hospitable people welldeveloped infrastructure and a rich variety of delicious cuisine China welcomes you as well as all peaceloving and kindhearted friends to visit and explore this magnificent country
WHEN THE STREAM START AFTER 25 MINS WE GOT TWO CHINA PERSON HAVE YOUTUBE
As an indian i feel like why i born in india China is beautiful and all the people of china are so well behaved
I once thought Speed was just a quirky internet celebrity and never paid much attention to him This time seeing him come to my motherland China I discovered his smart polite and thoughtful side Although hes playful its all within a very safe boundary This made me see young Americans in a new light The negative reports in the news are always about people hurting each other and us ordinary folks get misled by the media too much I hope everyone can find the time to visit China Its not perfect but its worth a trip
hope you guys dont take the song seriously its just a joke not racist
Dude speed you formed a Chinese army of fans because of your insane experience
Longest irl stream cant believe he has this much energy keep going and dont give up G

Dont talkdown your country like that As a Chinese we were also poor and weak especially during the century humiliation but we study for our country and our home after being led by Mao We are making it better and I hope you guys also improving your country Search the meaning of the words on Tianan men
welcome to visit China one day
w6o yehh man but i am not trying to talkdown of my country but everyday i hear news of caste based discrimination rap and murder therfore i felt like yours is bigger than mine
RajuRastogi555 Broyou have to study hard If you have more talents and knowledge you can choose to apply for a job in a foreign company in China If you like a place you will go there because life is a journey You have experienced it If you have walked this road you will not regret it
Yeah everyone knows that

andylee1522
Welcome to the real China my friend
Thank you bro
p8r I thought Chinese is rude Or dont like foreign visitors
redsoxfox4447 In fact Chinese people are extremely friendly to foreigners so friendly that girls in our country are proud of having a foreign boyfriendOn the other hand so do men
redsoxfox4447 Our domestic media only report bad news from abroad based on security issues in case something bad happens to citizens when they travel abroad The remaining experts and scholars such as culture food politics and culture have already praised them to the skyIn this case how can Chinese be unfriendly to foreigners On the contrary it is too friendly and causes some Chinese people to be very sad because they feel that they are better to foreigners than to ourselves
p8r so its safe speed stream in china
redsoxfox4447 Of course my friend
redsoxfox4447 He is now rushing into social media in China like a hurricaneNo one dares to hurt him when his name stays at the top of the search bar
p8r sorry forgive me what you gonna say about the police Is it ok Nothing to worry Because he gets interrupt by police 2 times
redsoxfox4447 That policeman is OKBecause China has a large population in order to avoid stampede accidents and crowded accidents like those in itaewon South Korea they need to make sure that there are not many people in a very small place but the popularity of speed is beyond imagination as you should knowSo theyre just protecting the crowd and speedEven if you communicate with speed you will only ask what speed is here for and then cooperate with him to ensure that the live broadcast will not have bad effects
redsoxfox4447 Only crazy people who take the initiative to hit people everywhere will be detainedObviously this is not what YouTuber would doSo its completely OK
redsoxfox4447 So on the other hand if you have a lot of popularity in China to attract the police it is equivalent to having a free bodyguard
4600 YALL SEARCHING FOR THIS
This translator is a disaster I dont think he knows Chinese or even lived in China before I even wonder if he hate China so he translate in the most rude way and wrong in so many parts

flx0666 W is short for the word win which is used to describe good genuinely positive things in the stream
5 Cops chasing
Jackson Wang reminded them But it seemed like they didnt care about it and kept being so rude and disrespectful
sorry speed Jackson is an almost professional athlete but he is a professional idol and a professional competitive person
Like if Speed should do a stream with rumistream on twitch
Damn China looks nice the propaganda in the west made me think it was a dump
Speed visit the most developed and most powerful country before GTA 6
We got 37mili Green Apple shirt and 6 hour stream best of the best
Your pinkhair interpreter is not translating for you He taught very rude words and manner to your bodyguards I dont think it does anything good to you if your bodyguards continue being rude to people around you
Jackson Wang is a very famous Singer Rapper Song writer in China He is also good at street dance and fashion brands He is a global partner with both Nike and Jordan Brand He has very good personality You can tell hes very nice when he is playing ping pong with Speed
Respect for camera man who continuously holding the camera
Now speed is officially made in china
Visited China twice this year and its AMAZING didnt want to leave
Bro china has better technology and technique than America does
Jacksong Wang was perfect to match the vibe
60934 yooo this driver is crazy
As a Chinese the pink hair dude is goofy as fHe doesnt know how to translate
I really need to visit China hopefully the people are kind
What is he famous for
mynameistriplew he was an olympic fencer but now is in kpop group GOT7 and a solo artist in China
Why do you need to say sorry here
Its china what did u expect
We are already developing 6G technogy thats why
Because u didnt watched full stream bro
They invented 5G
Yes the entire stream had minimum lag the quality of stream was better than any other country speed has ever been Chinas internet quality is the best out of all the country the stream faced little lag at the end that too because speed was going from backside of the mall other than that the whole stream looked good its even in 2k Quality this time speeds first 2k Quality irl stream
Ye Im a Chinese who came to the UK for study and I m frustrated because of the shitty internet almost everywhere if you are not in the main cities like London
q9h Can someone translate this
junxifu2708 indians too
josephkariba8676 indians also invented 5G
q9h does there exist YouTube in China
ilyas8659 A vpn is required to connect to youtube but VPNS are also common in China We have a whole Internet culture that belongs to our own system youtube tiktok instagram all have a variety of alternatives in China and our Internet products are no worse than the the United States
yiransun862 wow i really didnt know i thought youtube and other west media were banned
ilyas8659 You are right that China does not have access to a lot of foreign media and the use of VPNS is prohibited on a legal level But as long as you dont use VPNS for illegal things such as spreading pornography gambling rumormongering etc no one will bother you
Muzakkir007 no they didnt lil bro
yiransun862 thanks for the information
q9h okay boss aint nobody saying china is not advanced
Man i wish Germany had Internet like this xD
junxifu2708 bro can you clear up something for me is using YouTube legal in China I know lot of Chinese people just use VPN but could it become trouble
JohnSmithxt4jx YouTubeVPNVPN
cresbii bro i am using 5G internet and I am from india brother
Haha the speed of the Chinese internet is still very fast
Towards the 5 hour mark it lagged a lot where he git a haircut and stuff
i want so bad That ishowspeed try the advanced technology by HUAWEI like HUAWEIs NEARLINK and HUAWEIs Kunlun glass and HUAWEIs Car and HUAWEIs Share with Hands and HUAWEIs HarmonyOS NEXT and HUAWEI mate xt tri fold and HUAWEI pura x HUAWEIs technology is soo advanced no other company come near Even deepseek Usess HUAWEIs CPU and HUAWEI will make HarmonyOS pc HUAWEI doesnt just survive the ban but they destroy the bad and every company is shaken i wonder when ishowspeed will know this But he is a good guy cool and kind we need that
I guess china really is in 2050 already
China gonna have 6G so i can say their internet is top one
what about watching tho
q9h bro he said the internet is very good in china he didnt mean anything bad
ilyas8659The number of Chinese who watch ytb and any other western website through vpn in mainland China may equal to some small countries population So doesnt exist but exist
bro 80 million isnt small XingruShan
manenwan Hes Taiwanese for the exact reason you know
South Korea has great reception as well
josephkariba8676 5g first started in South korea not china
q9h he said that becouse every place speed did the stream the internet just lagged
31141 aight bet
thats why american baneed HUAWEI because it is the best 5G in the world
junxifu2708 6g So Huawei has 6g inside China only In Greece we get Huawei phones but their modems are 5g but some bullshit with governments is going on and 5g is disabled on Huawei phones so only iPhone snapdragon and mediatek got 5g and wifi 6 and 7
Well it is outside the big cities and even the cities themselves hide their bad parts
darpmosh6601 This is applicable to the whole world
darpmosh6601 lol this guy is still going
darpmosh6601 new to the world Been to other parts of Asia as im from Asia No country compares to chyna BTW you said only big cities and bad side of cities Been to Shanghai Shenzhen Chengdu Zhuhai Hangzhou I have never seen what you said even in the outskirt The outskirt are more calm relaxed and clean than the mega skyscraper areas Dont just spew nonsense
Bro theres too much misinformation on the internet
de02henry what about Switzerland Norway
ruarika3112 Ive lived there China has problems with trash trash burning smog unemployment as well as many other problems Maybe its not so bad on the surface but I gurarantee you the longer you stay there the more obvious the problems are Problem is you cant say that sometimes or else you get banned off of social media
Hello Taiwaneses frog
darpmosh6601 Its okay at least there is no violent crime robbery injury or anything like that
darpmosh6601 ok so u mean the cities in the us are worse thank they look like
iloveHXC4ever Some Cities in the US are really bad but at least we dont lie to ourselves about how good we really are Ive actually seen Chinese people lie about the state of their cities like its flawless when in fact it is not
darpmosh6601 Please move on to the next lie
craftah Tiny Country China not only has big cities with a population of 20 to 30 million but also some small and beautiful cities that you have never heard of Their scenery and cleanliness even surpass those of big cities
darpmosh6601 Chinese goverment is afraid of its people That why it works really hard to improve
jenniferzhang864 If they truly work really hard like that then they would actively ask for critiques but you get banned for posting many things critical I doubt that
My comments were only removed in the YT Never in Xiaohongshu Who doesnt allow me to speak I am a Chines American who live in the USA for over 20 years and travel all over the world Chinese goverment is the best
darpmosh6601 What kind of trash are you talking about Is there a perfect place in the world
Powerful country
Speeds bodyguards are very RUDE Not just because of the wrong words also the behaviors They were almost attacking friendly Chinese young kids So rude Unacceptable Ruining Speeds image
Always the same guy Lol The funniest coment I see Full respect
I get it speed has endangered the national security of the United States
As a westerner I can say that we didnt even notice the vibes were off Stream was cool and cozy from our perspective since wemostly dont speak mandarin Apparently it was hard for the chinese people to watch because of this guy Much love from Billions must see the true China

Chinese people are saying the translator is bad and rude The stream wouldve been way better if he had another guy I would give a 810 as a westernerbrazilian
yea it was peak like movie fiction
Exactly bro even I can translate better for him
Why yall called him rude what was he doin
probably his team outsource some of the work to some random Chinese companythey dont really understand how speed wanna stream
some of his wording to people around them is red flag its hard for you guys to find that out because he was doing that only when using chinese
This pink translator is extremely impolite in Chinese traditional culture he even pointed at passersby arrogantly and didnt say thank you after asking questions The Chinese phrase get out of the way he taught Speeds bodyguards is also very impolite It should be please make wayjie guorang yi xia
krave0310 Just to clarifywhen I said shady deal I meant some underthetable arrangement between that pinkhaired guy and the MCN agency Dont wanna get misunderstood here
whatt
mynameistriplew The hired translator doesnt even know Chinese
The translator needed a translator
The 1500 horsepower car is the new Xiaomi SU7 ULTRA BOOST
amazing country love from india you are too much better than us in all aspects you will be the global leader
Thr different cities have their individual pride and character
The security keep saying Rang Kai Rangkai which means go away go away in Chinese You can say like Jie Guo which is more polite way of saying excuse me
The guy he played ping pong is a famous Chinese rapper and model 32 millions on instagram
The internet in china is so good not gonna lie
Its a pity that Speed didnt get to visit Guizhou the most beautiful city in western China Here youll find stunning landscapes delicious food and warm friendly people If you have the chance to visit China again start your journey in Guizhou and explore the magnificent western region We also hope friends from all over the world can come to China experience our hospitality and enjoy the beauty of our country
Social anxiety fears speed

Becouse they use internet for everything daily payments and stuff
Younger generation knows him But this shop is for elders
Older generation individuals arent really stream watchers XD
Nah he will start it with Argentina
For real Like the police do not care you use a vpn lmao He thought it was american police and he was reaching so hard The cameraman also lied about the super fast chinese electric car too saying it charges in 30 mins when it actually charges in 5 Way faster than tesla China is goated
thesmokeycloud no he is partially right It is indeed true that china has developed cars that can charge in 5 minutes but that car wasnt one of them but it charges faster than tesla for sure
You guys are amazing
Its all business in the morning Its boring to watch Its interesting to live in the evening
yzu8wb what s mean

Its a code made by him to end the stream
wanport what code mean

IShowSpeeds Journey to China Provides Foreign Audiences with an Alternative Channel to Understand the Real China
I cant believe China is a beautiful country
its annoying that the bodyguards just pushes them back so roughly
2114 At first he measured the pulse so that he knew if it was an insult
Your country is nice and good quality
yeah poor lady reminds me of my grandma for some reason
Dont be she is probably richer than any of us lol Her spot is literally the golden spot for vendors there in Shanghai
Truetheres no streamer like him to streaming such like this in China beforethis guy is making history I hope the rest of his streaming goes wellcuz I saw the police chase them away several times
Politically how Its just humanity not politics Which is really important because we might forget about its importance BECAUSE of politics
The police need to ensure that the crowd does not gather in large numbers and avoid stampedes all of which are to protect the safety of passersby It is rude for the police in charge to be said so by you
xiaochengcu6kw wellwe shell see
Nobody insults for language tho
nobody insults the food either
Only China and its people have the right to insult people for their food and culture like they do with India Korea and Japan Others shouldnt insult china at all
zbaker330 Someone think we eat pet
xiaochangf7w you do eat cats and dogs There are literal festivals
Unknownie6sq plenty of Chinese love anime and kpop Actually there are more people who criticize the Chinese in Korea and India than chinese criticizing them
Unknownie6sq You dont know about chinese culture you dont know it brou
sugarrushp2w Yeah thats true
Unknownie6sq In China is illegal sending those meats in open places So thats not festival about that
People just insult the government
PretzelGod647 Trust me government isnt that bad Its not bad
Unknownie6sq We prefer eggs Oh by the way can you afford eggs
Jackson is amazing
Bro went in to the cage with lion
Most peaceful country in the world The only country in history rising and become superpower in peace

Congratulations on 37M man this stream was hilarious also loved the drivers energy at the end
52308 that word santai has already planted in his subsconscious mind
I thought Chinese people were rude and racist but they are nice
There are really many activities in China and you can go out safely at night
Your body guard should use rather than that will be much more polite and easier for Chinese know what your team mean
W streeam 6 hour irl stream is crazy
There is no hatred between people from different ethnic groups and countries around the world and it should be so beautiful
Translator so useless lol
The translator just tranlate everything in the most rude way Please fire him

China is the best country in the world Im glad you choose Shanghai to be your first station my hometown welcomes you And enjoy the trip in CN
My parents said if I get 200k followers theyd buy me a highend editing PC for my Youtube videos Begging you guys literally begging
Welcome to Chinabelieve that we love you guysNo racist
The people usa who are actually rude and racist tells you another place is rude and racist
thats what ur media teached not true
that song is just a joke dont take it seriously
Most of us look like racists but we really dont care We didnt do anything like enslaving or genocide so we dont feel guilty about the rascist jokes or whatever
Most Chinese people are also very friendly to foreigners who are not celebrities or internet celebrities
As AmericanChinese theyre only racist towards Southeast Asians I went to Beijing and the comments were mostly towards Vietnamese Filipino Thai Myanmar etc
zhanghua1998 NOIm Chinese We dont discriminate against Southeast Asians Chinese often travels to Malaysia Thailand and Singapore We build the fastest train in the world for Indonesia and Vietnam is our brother country
Not true U r trolling or what LOL
This is a Chinese song and has nothing to do with English
Translators fault for teaching them that though
My back is hurt only sat watching the whole stream
Holy shit its animeballsdeep cant believe you are in an ishowspeed comment section
i think the translater is not Chinesemaybe Korean
This guy is being attacked by the Chinese Internet
Jenny do you know Jesus is a prophet of God God has no son
China way more lit than I thought W
Imagine Speed doing a livestream from North Korea that would break the internet fr
Dear Speed Mr Speed it would be nice if you use a voice sighter in your video so that fans in various voices understand what you say
Its so rude saying rang kai in chinese that means go away
41046 but Google is banned in china btw shes the most lucky person who travelled with speed all alone without knowing whos this guy
Bro got cooked by Chinese basketball player and nobody mention it crazyy
I will visit china someday amazing country
Indonesians people is everywhere that satuduatiga
Next North Korea speed
If it was Western media they would have said the Chinese government didnt allow him to stream and they took away his equipment and sent him to jail
I have to said that his body guards were so rude that they keep saying get off in Chinese
4144 100 wife material stronger than NA boys facebluesmiling
In fact after I watched all other streams and watched Shanghai session the last I think this Shanghai session was probably the worst It seems unorganized at all Not showing much of Shanghai at all
Glad Speed opened your mind
Too bad most people will never realise as they have been deeply misled And some are personally choosing to remain ignorant about China
Welcome to the real world away from fake news
Lol Bfo this is chinese Propaganda
I wouldnt want him to go there its not safe
You cant use YouTube in northkorea There is no connection with the outside world at all Maybe he can just release a recorded one in live
Thats never happening by the way North Korea is very strict about any sort of western influence in there
Then what about shankai
too rude more than rangkai
wait so If I personally havent harmed a Black person ever before I can say that to them btw we capitalize the B in BLACK here have respect and please speak english
Metapharsical
whats the name of the person playing basketball
ThatCray nahthat chinese guy name bro
expectation
No actually there were more korean in his stream
CCCCCCCCC
Ur not even from there north korea kids dont do sht like this
Bro wants Speed rot in jail in NK lmao
Russia next
Chindo
You want the guards to say please get off next time
thekevinrocks99 I mean they word they chose is inappropriate they are very rude and disrespect
HeisenbergKarlt2q so how do you expect two guards to protect one person against hundreds of fans and potentially crazy fans Their job is to protect not to be nice Put yourself in Kais shoes would you have your guards be slightly rude or have your safety compromised
thekevinrocks99 they are not just fans there are also people just walking on the streets
HeisenbergKarlt2q well blame the fans then they are they ones following him and making it difficult for the other people on the street
thekevinrocks99 yes
actually that word in China is not the offensive one he is sensitive thekevinrocks99
diobrando9376 thank you
It might have been told by those unprofessional MCN employees
thekevinrocks99 You should be nice as a person and an outsider
Yang02517 you can say the same to the fans yelling and trying to touch another person
I think they said that the pink hair guy told them to say that since they dont know what that means they trusted him and believed it was a good way of saying to move out the way
Bro they got a bad translator
diobrando9376 It is especially when they were shoutingyelling its like shoutingyelling movemove away in English to random people on the streets Its disrespectful and rude to other nonfan people just passing by His translator should have taught them more correct words
Who name girl SenOzhik

people are complaining about it but the ones that are spamming it in his comments
Naw we dont ban words Speeds community isnt soft
IShowSpeeds live streaming of travel in China has attracted widespread global attention
The funny thing is when theres prohibited to use youtube in China for citizens Speed is streaming to the world
If Somali is respectful like him he wouldnt be hated so much
4543 They removed the song
Speed came to China He didnt know that there were so many people who knew him and liked him living in this magical land The fans here showed him unimaginable enthusiasm What shocked him and his team was that the fans here respected him very much They were excited but very restrained when they saw him They knew that he was tired and would give him water They knew that he was hungry and would feed him This was the case in every city he passed through Because this is the Chinese etiquette of hospitality Friends coming from afar must be fed and wellnourished He met Tian Yiming and sang his favorite song Love You at 105 Degrees together He climbed the Great Wall and saw the super weapon of Chinese aunties Level 10 Beauty He went to Shaolin Temple made friends through martial arts and met Master Liang who may be the best martial arts teacher in his life He ate an authentic Chengdu hot pot and tasted what authentic spicy and hot is He saw why Chongqing is called the cyberpunk city and also showed the world the real shock of China beyond the foreign media filter He had a beautiful encounter on a cruise ship in Hong Kong that saved the entire live broadcast A sweet girl from Zhejiang showed him the cuteness friendliness innocence and romance of Chinese girls He experienced the hightech from China in Shenzhen that stunned the world He finally came to Changsha and finally met Da Zhangwei and sang Sunshine Rainbow Little White Horse together It was also because of Da Zhangweis popular song that he won countless fans in China He also met a friendly and enthusiastic Chinese uncle who treated him as a brother He followed him all the way in various cities in China and took care of him willingly This is the best interpretation of fate and friendship from Chinese men Thank you Speed thank you for showing the world the true side of this country and the people on this land There is an old Chinese saying It is a great pleasure to have friends coming from afar All people in the world are brothers I guess Speed has realized the meaning of this sentence during his trip to China
Thr different cities have their individual pride and character
jackson touchin his booty during dragon dance lmaooo
chinas people are humble and nicelove from Bangladesh
Last week I went to Shanghai for a school trip and I wouldve seen him if the school trip was earlier
His bodyguard is so good

Who the heck is the translator Speed said hell give the money to the man but the translator told the man speed wanted Im to do 10 push ups in order to get the money
I didnt watch the full stream but if he havent then he should try the Chinese subway They are way safer and cleaner than the ones in New York and they have English translations too
Chinese people are so respectful TO SPEED
11657 telling the kids to quit vaping is cool

China might not be an Utopia but its the best country i have ever seen W China

Chinese are discriminated against in many places abroad but speed is welcomed and respected in China What I want to say is that we have not changed our minds because of longterm discrimination but please respect the Chinese Dont insult the Chinese people
The people here are warm and welcoming making you feel at home
Shanghai is a modern city with high capacity the convenient life style and high medical level here made it a dream place for people to live

Let me tell you a story Uncle Duck in a red coat is actually a very good person He is dedicated to promoting the specialties of his hometown many of which are public welfare Similarly he wants to appear on Speeds live broadcasts all the time just to promote his hometowns products so that Chinese consumers can know about their hometowns specialties Moreover he often appears in various public welfare activities such as helping the elderly in nursing homes and earthquake relief He is a volunteer and has many government issued public welfare honor certificates Many people think he is an Internet clown but I dont think so I admire him very much If he frequently enters the live broadcast and disturbs everyone I am willing to apologize for him He is really a good person

What we dont know about this video is bigger than what you see Love you ispeed Do more videos please
China is a very beautiful country
Never thought china allowed western content creators stream in they country
Bodyguards are just there to break the crowds apart when it gets too hectic Sometimes Speed can barely walk or have diehard fans annoying him for pictures or signatures when he has his attention somewhere else I mean that recent stream in Chengdu was a perfect example why he needs a lot But in terms of Safety youre right
speed need to hire a good translator though The two guys speed hired are bouncers For a typical club in US they are good choice I believe speed needs to hire ex military or ex police men to be his body guards like secret service folks
As a local from Uncles hometown I warmly welcome everyone to visit Rongchang If youre planning a trip feel free to contact me for insider tips
I completely agree
Look forward to your next coming

I dont know this American blogger I only saw his video jumping over a car once on Instagram but I didnt care much about it I dont understand why after he came to China Douyin has been pushing his videos the day before yesterday I am familiar with Chengdu so I found that after he went to Chengdu he was exposed to ear cleaning massage hot pot and pandas Yes these are quite common in Chengdu but I dont understand why there are so many fans in China who come to see him For our generation this foreign blogger we dont know him at all and we wont watch any of his videos I think its probably because the news of his coming to China was reported by most media In fact Chengdu people are quite arrogant they wont easily surround foreigners If you dont believe it live in Chengdu for a month and you will find that gradually no one will pay attention to you Everyone lives their own life and only regards you as an ordinary person This is the essence of life Finally welcome to Chengdu
come to north Korea and russia
